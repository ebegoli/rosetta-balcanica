Glossary
This glossary serves to clarify key terms used in this report.
The definitions are for this report only and are not official OSCE definitions.
Community - women, men, social groups and institutions that are based in the same area and/or have shared interests.
Civil society – a diverse body of civil actors, communities, and formal or informal associations with a wide range of roles who engage in public life, seeking to advance shared values and objectives.
Civil society actors – key representatives of the community including women, youth, community and religious leaders who are well positioned to provide impactful and long-lasting contributions to the well-being of society.
Community policing – a philosophy and organizational strategy that promote partnerships between the police force and the public to increase the effective and efficient identification, prevention and resolution of problems of crime, and address concerns about physical safety and security, social disorder and neighbourhood decay in order to improve the quality of life for everyone.
Countering violent extremism – proactive actions to counter efforts by violent extremists to radicalize, recruit and mobilize followers to engage in violent acts and to address specific factors that facilitate and enable violent extremist recruitment and radicalization to violence.
Counter-terrorism – policies, laws and strategies developed by state actors and implemented primarily by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and sometimes the military, aimed at thwarting terrorist plots and dismantling terrorist organizations
“Foreign terrorist fighters” – commonly used to refer to individuals who have travelled from their home states to other states to participate in or support terrorist acts, including in the context of armed conflict, especially in Iraq and Syria, as outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014).
The term is contested because of its breadth, vagueness, and associated human rights issues.
Former violent extremists or “formers” – individuals who have disengaged from a path to violent extremism and radicalization that lead to terrorism and who can have a useful role in raising awareness and communicating credible counternarratives.
Gender perspective – awareness and consideration of differential needs, experiences, and status of women and men based on socio-cultural context.
Intervention programming – programmes that target “at-risk” audiences and seek to intervene in a person’s pathway to terrorist radicalization before the line of criminal activity is crossed.
Prevention programming – programmes that seek to reduce the appeal of violent extremism and build resilience to its influence and spread.
The types of programmes that may fall under this category are: awareness raising on the threat of violent extremism in schools, public information campaigns and community debates, inter-faith and intra-faith dialogues, capacity building for teachers and community leaders in identifying and supporting those vulnerable to radicalization, media messaging and counter-/alternative narrative campaigns, and community trust building with law enforcement, etc.
Protective factors – positive characteristics or conditions that can moderate the negative effects of risk factors and foster healthier individuals, families, and communities, thereby increasing personal and/or community safety and wellbeing.
These factors can include expectation management, positive family or social networks, religious knowledge, education that teaches tolerance and respect for others, and a fairer job market.
Radicalization that leads to terrorism – the dynamic process whereby an individual comes to accept terrorist violence as a possible, perhaps even legitimate, course of action.
This may eventually, but not necessarily, lead this person to advocate, act in support of, or to engage in, terrorism.
Rehabilitation programming – programmes that target individuals radicalized to violence and possibly their families at different stages of radicalization.
The types of programmes include both prison-based de-radicalization/disengagement and post-criminal aftercare programmes focusing on the rehabilitation and reintegration of terrorist offenders and returning foreign fighters, and their reentry into society.
Some programmes offer educational and vocational training, counselling, employment opportunities and ideological re-education, etc.
Referrals – include individuals who are referred to multiagency or other multistakeholder programmes and who display observable behaviours indicating they might be at risk of or vulnerable to engagement in VERLT or already on the path to VERLT.
Referrals also include individuals whom a program refers to an agency, institution, organization, or professionals for an intervention or other support following a professional assessment of the individual’s risks, vulnerabilities, and protective factors.
Referral mechanism – a formal or informal mechanism involving practitioners and professionals from different disciplines and/or agencies and organizations that aims to identify, assess, assist, and treat those individuals showing signs of being at risk of or vulnerable to engagement in VERLT or already on the path to VERLT.
Resilience – the ability to withstand, respond to and recover from a wide range of harmful and adverse events.
Risk assessment – the process involving the systematic gathering and interpretation of information pertaining to an individual to provide data for properly trained professionals to make decisions relevant to the likelihood that a specific individual will engage in harmful action and to assess the nature and severity of the harm.
Risk assessment tool – a framework for collecting data to assist with decisionmaking that provides a non-discriminatory method for examining in a structured way an individual’s propensity to cause harm and the nature and severity of that risk, based on available information from multiple sources.
Risk factor – any attribute such as belief, appearance, experience, or environment that increases the likelihood of the outcome being measured (e.g., that an individual will engage in VERLT) occurring.
Whole-of-society approach – an approach to preventing and countering violent extremism advocated by policymakers and practitioners that envisions a role for multiple sectors and civil society actors in prevention, intervention, and deradicalization/disengagement rehabilitation programmes.
1. INTRODUCTION
The spread of violent extremism continues to pose a serious global challenge that the OSCE is committed to preventing and countering through its comprehensive approach to security while ensuring that human rights and the rule of law are respected.
The rapid rise of Daesh/ISIS in Iraq and Syria resulted in hundreds of foreign terrorist fighters leaving the Western Balkans to support their cause, including an estimated 110 citizens from the Republic of North Macedonia that may be higher given that no recent official data exist.
The dismantling of many Daesh safe havens since 2017 has also created a new set of challenges due to the flow of returning foreign terrorist fighters to the region.
At the same time, the threat of violent extremism continues to evolve, with new forms emerging – such as far-right movements and extreme nationalism – which further polarize societies and may also lead to community-based violence.
The OSCE Ministerial Council Declaration 4/15 affirms that terrorism and violent extremism cannot be linked to any race, ethnicity, nationality or religion.
It is widely acknowledged that violent extremism and radicalization that leads to terrorism (VERLT) is a complex problem with transnational dimensions, yet its drivers and solutions are closely tied to the context in which it exists.
In addition to national governments playing a vital role in coordinating and supporting early prevention activities, the OSCE also recognizes the need to place local stakeholders at the forefront of prevention efforts.
The importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to preventing and countering VERLT
In line with established best practice in the OSCE, P/CVERLT requires a holistic approach with the engagement of diverse institutions and civil society together with local communities.
In particular, a public health approach to prevention programming offers opportunities for practitioners to use lessons learned from the field of disease prevention through multi-stakeholder initiatives to identify risk and protective factors, build community resilience and promote healthy behaviours through community engagement.
These multi-stakeholder practices, when combined with community-led efforts to prevent violent extremism, have the advantage of broadly including social workers, mental health workers, psychologists and other health workers who are increasingly becoming involved in efforts to reduce violence in communities.
Using a whole-of-society approach recognizes the social roots of the phenomenon of violent extremism and allows for early interventions and non-coercive solutions when individuals or communities are at risk by addressing the factors conducive to VERLT.
The identification of sustainable solutions for building resilience to VERLT also necessitates a shift from past security-led approaches towards a greater emphasis on community-based prevention.
P/CVERLT efforts therefore seek to mobilize and empower stakeholders not traditionally associated with national security.
In contrast to countering terrorism, which uses a repressive approach in dealing with the criminal space, P/CVERLT is non-coercive in nature and focuses on preventing and countering processes of radicalization that may lead to terrorism.
As P/CVERLT efforts are undertaken in the pre-criminal space, they do not involve prosecutions, arrests, or other repressive measures.
The aim of P/CVERLT is accordingly not to reach individuals who have already crossed into the criminal realm, i.e. planning or undertaking terrorist activity, but rather to build resilience among communities seen as potentially vulnerable to the appeal of violent extremism and to assist individuals willing to disengage from violent extremism and reintegrate into their communities.
P/CVERLT focuses on addressing and reducing grievances and structural social, economic, and political conditions that may be conducive to violent extremism.
Violent extremists often work towards inciting individual and collective hatred, promoting intolerance towards diversity, and creating societal divisions.
Therefore, supporting the development of resilient and socially cohesive communities can be the best defense against violent extremism from taking root.
In working together, communities can counter the corrosive appeal of violent extremism by promoting tolerance, mutual respect, pluralism, inclusion, and cohesion.
Ultimately, P/CVERLT efforts should center on the wellbeing and safety of communities and individuals.
P/CVERLT efforts entail a broad range of programming that can include, for example, awareness raising, capacity building, counter and alternative narrative messaging, targeted programs for schools, extracurricular activities (e.g., youth and sports clubs), mentoring by religious and community leaders, and individually tailored interventions organized by local public institutions and psycho-social service providers.
These activities can be categorized according to whether they pertain to prevention, intervention, or rehabilitation and reintegration.
Rationale behind local-level roundtables
In February 2018, the OSCE Mission to Skopje, in partnership with the British Embassy, facilitated two public consultation roundtables with local stakeholders to inform the drafting of the Government’s revised Strategies and Action Plans for Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) and Counterterrorism (CT), under the National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Counter-terrorism (NCCVECT).
This effort for a consultative drafting process was the first in the region of the Western Balkans and one of few such examples globally.
Following the adoption of the National Strategy, the Mission organized a series of roundtables with key local stakeholders in fall 2018 as part of a strategic communications campaign in support of the NCCVECT to disseminate the Strategy. With the participation of the National Coordinator’s Office, the roundtables served to enhance transparency and ensure consistency in strategy messaging at the local level.
The roundtables were organized in ten geographically dispersed municipalities: Chair (Skopje), Gostivar, Kichevo, Kumanovo, Prilep, Shtip, Struga, Strumica, Tetovo, and Veles.
In order to promote a multi-stakeholder, community-based approach to the implementation of the National Strategy and Action Plan, the roundtables sought to include the participation of representatives from the municipal administration, civil society, local institutions, educators, psycho-social care providers, youth, religious leaders and other influential members of the local community.
Objectives of the roundtables
In addition to raising awareness of local stakeholders of the risks of VERLT, the primary aim of the roundtables was to foster ownership and buy-in from local institutions, civil society and communities for implementing the National Strategy and Action Plan for CVE.
The roundtables also provided a crucial opportunity to assess the needs and priorities in each Municipality for adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to implementing the National Strategy and Action Plan in the local context.
With consideration given to the sensitivities surrounding P/CVERLT, the Mission’s whole-of-society approach aimed to achieve a number of outcomes from the roundtables, including
Promoting a holistic understanding of violent extremism that addresses the phenomenon in all forms (e.g., right wing, exclusivist nationalist, political), thus reducing the stigma of ethnic and religious communities and allowing for broadened discussions on what forms of violent extremism exist in the country and in the local context.
Supporting a shift from the traditional security-led approaches towards emphasizing a whole-of-society approach that serves to empower community stakeholders by treating them as key parts of the solution.
Providing a safe space and platform for dialogue for participants to voice their concerns openly and initiate confidence-building both between local communities and with government structures.
Empowering stakeholders to establish channels for enhanced communication and co-operation.
Identifying potential challenges and opportunities for a multi-stakeholder approach to the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan.
Clarifying roles and responsibilities between the central and local government, and between government and civil society.
Collaboratively identifying findings and recommendations to serve as a preliminary basis for the future development of local action plans.
This report provides a summary overview of the local stakeholder-led discussions in the ten municipal roundtables.
The next section provides a description of the methodology of the roundtables, followed by the key findings and conclusions.
The final section elaborates recommended best practices drawn from the findings for implementing P/CVERLT programming.
An annex provides a detailed overview into the proceedings of the roundtables in Chair, Gostivar, Kumanovo, Struga, and Tetovo in the form of reports developed by the OSCE Mission to Skopje’s implementing partner, the Center for Research and Policy Making (CRPM).
As one of its main objectives, the report seeks to highlight the importance of promoting a multi-stakeholder approach to implementing the National Strategy for CVE with an understanding of a shared responsibility for security.
The roundtable findings also serve to demonstrate the benefit of ensuring an inclusive process in the conceptualization and design of policies and strategies on P/CVERLT, both at the national and local level.
The report is written for a broad audience, including policymakers and practitioners who are working to develop and implement P/CVERLT policies, strategies, action plans, and programmes.
It is also specifically written for local stakeholders – including municipal authorities and other local institutions, and local practitioners and professionals, as well as members of civil society — who might be involved in the design and implementation of P/CVERLT programmes.
Finally, the report is also intended to raise awareness of the importance of trustbased collaboration between policymakers and practitioners when developing and realizing these programmes.
2. METHODOLOGY OF THE ROUNDTABLES WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS
The Mission based the methodology of the roundtables on the same whole-ofsociety approach it applied in designing and carrying out the public consultations for the drafting of the National Strategy for CVE in early 2018.
In pioneering an ambitious and inclusive approach to promoting multi-stakeholder engagement in P/CVERLT, the roundtable methodology provides a valuable example of best practices for policymakers and practitioners involved in designing similar public outreach processes for other national strategies.
The following section provides an overview of the methodological approach used in selecting the municipalities and participants for the roundtables, as well as designing the structure of the guided discussions.
This section also discusses the harm reduction strategies and confidence-building measures used by the Mission when conducting outreach to local stakeholders.
Selection of municipalities and participants for the roundtables
The Mission, in coordination with the NCCVECT, selected the ten municipalities based on a list of criteria that ensured geographical diversity and avoided stigmatizing certain minority ethnic communities that could create the public perception that only these communities struggle with the challenge of VERLT.
Furthermore, allowing for broad coverage of the country in organizing the roundtables also shifted focus away from areas where ongoing and planned P/ CVERLT activities were already highly concentrated and reinforced the message that all forms of VERLT would be addressed.
In identifying participants for the roundtables, the Mission relied on its field presence to conduct outreach to an extensive network of stakeholders among local self-government institutions, civil society, educators, youth, religious and local community leaders, all of which play an important role in the community based-approach that is the basis of P/CVERLT.
In many cases, the roundtables represented the first time when all the relevant local stakeholders were brought together in the same room as part of a dialogue.
Intensive groundwork was carried out through numerous preparatory meetings with stakeholders to identify appropriate participants and to address any concerns, including risks of stigmatization.
In acknowledging the general lack of public awareness and sensitivity around P/CVERLT, the Mission focused on identifying individuals who had prior experience with the subject matter or whose work was in a closely related field.
In identifying participants, the Mission took great care to ensure diverse representation of all ethnic and religious communities present in each municipal context.
Particular emphasis was placed on ensuring that the needs and perspectives of the smaller minority communities were reflected in the roundtable discussions.
Participants were also invited from local women’s and youth groups to further enrich the discussion and empower these groups in building coalitions within civil society and to increase co-operation with local institutions.
The design of the roundtables had to contend with P/CVERLT’s legacy of predominantly focusing on religiously-inspired forms of VERLT, which has resulted in the stigmatization of certain religious communities and strained relations between these communities on the one hand and institutions and law enforcement on the other.
Another result of this legacy is that religious leaders often perceive that they are expected to have all the solutions to preventing and countering VERLT, even when they lack the appropriate capacities, resources, and necessary support from other stakeholders.
A whole-of-society approach to P/CVERLT avoids defining VERLT as a theological issue and thus placing the burden of responsibility solely on religious leaders, and instead recognizes VERLT as a social phenomenon that situates religious leaders among a collective of stakeholders committed to building community resilience.
In preparation for the roundtables, religious leaders were encouraged to use the open forum to express both their ideas and concerns while engaging in dialogue with the other stakeholders present. Additionally, in order to support trust-building, the Mission conducted on-the-ground outreach to local representatives of religious communities to clearly explain the purpose of the roundtables and address their grievances, particularly regarding stigmatization.
The preparatory meetings provided the opportunity to emphasize a holistic understanding of P/CVERLT, which encompasses all forms of violent extremism and refrains from targeting any particular ethnic or religious group, in addition to promoting a whole-ofsociety approach.
The Mission also sought to include teachers and other educational support staff (e.g., school psychologists, pedagogues) in the roundtables, given their important role in directly influencing the worldviews and values of youth during a critical period in their lives for their cognitive development and identity formation.
Teachers are also well placed to intervene and support a young person who may be struggling with or vulnerable to negative social phenomena.
At the same time, P/CVERLT efforts in the region tend to focus on building the capacities of educators to recognize signs of radicalization, with the risk of doing harm in the absence of proper training, instead of empowering them with the right tools to build the resilience of youth to VERLT (e.g., by reforming teaching methodologies and placing greater emphasis in the curriculum on fostering critical thinking, respect for diversity, and the promotion of non-violent behaviors).
With this in mind, the Mission also invited representatives of the regional units of the Bureau for Development of Education that work on developing school curricula, in addition to local education officers from the religious institutions who also play an important role in youth development.
Drawing from best practice in the domain of public health prevention efforts, the Mission also invited psycho-social care providers to participate in the roundtables.
Professionals in the fields of social welfare and mental health have extensive experience from initiatives supporting vulnerable individuals at risk of engaging in other types of negative social behaviors, such as youth delinquency.
Additionally, psycho-social care providers are bound by a professional code of ethics that governs the client-provider relationship through principles such as trust and emphasis on supporting the individual’s wellbeing.
Whereas an oversecuritized approach toward P/CVERLT with significant involvement of law enforcement can result in displacing and alienating psycho-social care providers, a public health approach creates the space for their engagement.
The purpose of including psycho-social care providers was thus to raise their awareness of VERLT and the important contribution they can make in bolstering protective factors.
Central to a do-no-harm approach in relation to VERLT is a nuanced understanding of community dynamics and sensitivities.
Given the sensitive nature of P/CVERLT, the Mission took into consideration the existing mistrust expressed by communities – especially minority ethnic communities -- towards institutions and law enforcement. Often in engagement efforts between police and the public, there is a perception that the security-driven agendas of law enforcement tend to displace other important local community concerns and grievances, especially when the interaction is one-way in nature.
Given the existing taboos around VERLT and the associated fears of negative repercussions from discussing the issue in the presence of law enforcement, the Mission prioritized the roundtables as a safe space for all participants to share their views on local problems and grievances.
Consequently, representatives of the police were not invited to the roundtables in order to ensure an open forum for discussion and to strengthen an understanding of P/CVERLT as a communitybased, multi-stakeholder effort carried out in a pre-criminal space.
This approach aimed to allow the community to feel engaged for their own benefit and that they too have an important stake in contributing to the security and wellbeing of their community.
Structure of the roundtables
Recognizing the taboos around VERLT and the general lack of public awareness in this area as of fall 2018, the Mission opted to structure the roundtables as fullday events to allow enough time for discussion to develop in sufficient depth.
Each roundtable accordingly began with an overview of key concepts and terminology to ensure that participants had a common understanding for the subsequent discussion sessions.
This conceptual session was then followed by a presentation of the National Strategy for CVE, led by the National Coordinator or his Deputy for CVE.
The active participation of the NCCVECT throughout the roundtables resulted in dynamic interaction between the central and local level by directly answering the queries of participants, as well as hearing first-hand their perspectives, grievances, and ideas for solutions.
The discussion sessions were organized around key intersectional areas and facilitated by an experienced moderator with the support of guiding questions prepared in advance of the roundtables.
Each of the thematic sessions allowed participants from all backgrounds to contribute to identifying local challenges and opportunities related to the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan in the local context.
Participants were informed that the “Chatham House Rule” would be applied in order to protect their identity and allow for an open discussion.
The roundtable sessions were organized around the following themes
Violent extremism in the local context.
Empowering civil society and sharing best practices.
Engagement between the municipality and community.
Building trust between communities and law enforcement.
The role of communities in the prevention of violent extremism.
Education and supporting at-risk youth.
The importance of social welfare and mental health.
Taking into account the sensitivity of discussing violent extremism with local communities, the Mission placed considerable emphasis on selecting moderators and rapporteurs with appropriate skills and abilities.
An additional consideration in identifying moderators and rapporteurs was building civil society capacity in the field of P/CVERLT to continue working on long-term policy change.
Consequently, the Mission identified CRPM, a leading policy think tank that was carrying out research, together with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in municipalities overlapping with those selected for the roundtables to assess local institutional capacities to implement the National Strategy.
By promoting synergies among initiatives, the Mission aimed to ensure that the research and roundtable discussions built upon each other for assisting the government, the local institutions and the civil society to create the best possible multi-stakeholder approach to P/CVERLT.
3. FINDINGS
This section provides an overview of the findings of the roundtables. Organized according to the structure of the sessions in most of the roundtables, the findings in each thematic area are complemented with attention to local specifics of particular interest.
3.1. Violent extremism in the local context
Taken together, the roundtables suggested that awareness of VERLT is generally low, and most roundtable participants took the position that violent extremism is not widespread in their municipality, though the issue of local citizens going to fight in Syria was raised in several roundtables.
Additionally, there was generally a high level of awareness that while violent extremism may start small, it can also grow quickly in the presence of visible examples/ role models.
It was also noted that discussion of VERLT is treated as a taboo, with the stifling effect on such discussion counterproductive from the standpoint of preventing violent extremism.
Participants also noted that violent extremism is most often associated with religious manifestations, resulting in the stigmatization of some communities, and identified right wing and nationalist extremism as also being prevalent in the country.
Notwithstanding the position of most roundtable participants that violent extremism is not widespread, the roundtables yielded evidence of the recognition of a fairly wide range of manifestations of the phenomenon.
On one end of the spectrum, roundtable participants mentioned graffiti expressing insults and violent intentions and/or ideas as a low-intensity form of violent extremism, with participants at the roundtable in Prilep noting also that the failure to remove such graffiti contributes to the normalization of such messages.
The roots of intolerance and hate first also manifest as verbal confrontations before escalating to physical violence, including most notably fights on inter-ethnic basis among secondary school students at schools and on public transportation.
Where hate speech and physical violence by sports (usually football) fan groups are concerned, the roundtables revealed widespread recognition of such activity as a form of violent extremism with participants in Chair noting alleged influence from political parties.
In Prilep, participants identified the burning of the Charshi Mosque and the effective expulsion of ethnic Albanian families in 2001 as an extreme manifestation of VERLT.
Discussion of the factors potentially conducive of VERLT pointed to the prominence of family-related concerns.
Common among roundtable participants was the view that the internal cohesion of families is not as strong as it once was, leading youth to seek identity and belonging in other kinds of groups, such as ethnic communities, political parties, religious communities, and sports fan groups.
In some roundtables, participants referred also to the absence of parents, often as a result of labor migration stemming from high unemployment.
At the roundtable in Chair, participants related the absence of a parent to increased vulnerability to extremist preachers.
Various issues of gender also received mention, including domestic violence, lack of respect for women in general, and, in Veles, conservative values preventing mothers from attending meetings in school.
In addition to family dynamics, roundtable participants identified a range of other causes of VERLT.
As mentioned above in relation to labor migration, economic conditions were frequently cited as a condition conducive to violent extremism.
As one participant in the roundtable in Veles put it, „We wouldn‘t be discussing these problems if [the living standard] were higher.“
Sometimes mentioned by roundtable participants in combination with poverty and unemployment was marginalization on ethnic and/or religious grounds.
Ethnic and religious marginalization was explained as a factor potentially influencing an individual’s search for identity and belonging in such a way as to make violent extremist groups more attractive.
Additionally, it was noted that some marginalized segments of society may seeks support from alternative religious groups outside of official religious institutions out of a perception that these groups are closer to the people and their needs.
Another type of cause identified in the roundtables relates to access to information.
As noted by roundtable participants, media often play a destructive role by spreading hate speech and playing up interethnic tensions in the way they cover incidents where the perpetrator is a member of a minority group.
Youth’s often unregulated access to mobile phones received frequent mention, and the hate speech common in media and social media was identified as a push factor toward violent extremism.
Also receiving frequent mention in the roundtables was the politicization of life and institutions in North Macedonia, sometimes in the form of incitement to extremism by political parties in power and by parties’ youth wings.
The storming of parliament on 27 April 2017 was mentioned in several roundtables as an example of political party involvement in violent extremism.
In Gostivar, participants pointed out that one extreme leads to another, especially where a culture of violence is normalized and politics is focused on hatred and/or revenge.
High levels of political polarization impede the functioning of institutions, leading in turn to a lack of public trust in those same institutions.
3.2. Empowering civil society and sharing best practices
Discussion of civil society in the roundtables pointed both to widespread recognition of civil society’s potential role in identifying and taking preventive action against various forms of violent extremism.
A wide range of variation across localities in civil society’s strength and relations with local communities and institutions was also noted.
While more capacity building on P/CVERLT is needed, participants also assessed that CSOs already have extensive experience in areas related to violence prevention and building social cohesion that could be better supported.
At the same time, participants urged caution towards involving CSOs that lack the appropriate expertise on P/CVERLT and suggested that more effort should be made to facilitate the sharing of best practices.
Participants also identified several areas in which CSOs can increase the focus of their activities in P/CVERLT, such as engaging parents in violence prevention, promoting human rights through nonformal education, and providing training to media organizations on conflict sensitivity in their reporting.
During the roundtable discussions, participants provided numerous examples of positive contributions by local CSOs to the prevention of violent extremism.
In Gostivar CSOs have been implementing various projects to build resilience within the local community, with relevant projects including digital skills training for marginalized youth and the opening of a youth center, as well as other initiatives focused on bringing together youth from diverse backgrounds.
As explained by roundtable participants, good relations between civil society and local government also led to the establishment in Gostivar of the country’s first municipal youth council; however it was noted that the youth council faces challenges with insufficient funding for activities.
Some CSOs in Kumanovo have not only taken a public stand against violent extremism, but also undertaken preventive work with youth susceptible to joining violent extremist groups abroad.
Additionally, the roundtables in Prilep and Tetovo revealed civil society capacity built in providing assistance to vulnerable individuals that could potentially be applied in relation to preventing violent extremism.
At the same time, participants at the roundtables in Kumanovo and Prilep noted that CSOs struggle to sustain long-term programming due to a lack of funds, with the discussion in Kumanovo identifying the need for donors to take local priorities and existing programming into account in allocating their funding.
Participants at the roundtable in Kumanovo also noted that while local civil society is relatively strong in its own right, co-operation between CSOs, schools, and municipal authorities needs strengthening.
Moreover, even in Gostivar, where roundtable participants assessed the position and role of civil society positively, it was noted that civil society had suffered in the past from pressure exerted by the state through politically targeted audits and inspections.
While the roundtable discussions in several municipalities yielded insight into the strengths of local civil society to prevent violent extremism, the roundtables in Chair and Struga showed a less positive situation.
In these municipalities, co-operation between civil society and local institutions is characterized as weak, with low levels of trust and awareness about local CSO programming on the part of local authorities.
Participants in the roundtables in Chair and Struga also made note of negative public perceptions of CSOs in these municipalities as being influenced by personal, political, and/or criminal agendas that effectively undermine the idea of volunteerism and civic activism.
Additional findings from the roundtable in Chair include low levels of awareness on the part of CSOs about the availability of municipal premises for their activities, as well as difficulties experienced by CSOs in obtaining funding from the municipality.
Finally, participants at the roundtable in Chair pointed out that most locally active CSOs are humanitarian, with few organizations implementing cultural activities or activities designed to raise civic awareness and engagement.
Concern was also raised by religious communities that some foreign funded humanitarian organizations were allegedly carrying out activities with political or religious undertones and non-transparent motivations.
3.3. Engagement between the municipality and community
