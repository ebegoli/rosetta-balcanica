INTRODUCTION
The Coalition “All for Fair Trials” is a network of 14 civic organisations in which members are local citizen associations for the purpose of monitoring trials before competent courts, in order to: a) ensure the guaranteed rights to fair trial as envisaged in the Constitution, laws and  ratified international agreements; b) increase the public awareness and underline the required reforms and the respective implementation concerning trials; c) enhance the practical knowledge of students of law; and d) strengthen the role and capacity of non-governmental organisations.
Given the current increasing necessity for trial monitoring, in particular concerning the field of criminal law, i.e. criminal procedure, in the course of 2016, the  Coalition, financially supported by the OSCE Mission to Skopje, implemented the project «Enhancing the independence, transparency and efficiency of the judiciary through trial monitoring”, as continuation of trial monitoring activities from the previous year.
It focused on the application of the new Law on Criminal Procedure in all four appellate regions in the country, specifically, in the basic courts, for the purpose of drafting a situational analysis along with recommendations for future activities and reforms, aimed at enhancing the capacities of the judicial system in the country.
METHODOLOGY
Monitors
15 monitors, with several-years long experience in trial monitoring throughout the country, were recruited for the needs of the project and for the preparation of the analysis, resulting from the available data from trial monitoring.
The monitors were required to have a university degree – a degree in law and thorough knowledge of criminal matters in order to be able to identify the most prevalent challenges encountered by the courts and all participants in criminal proceedings, as well as to detect the inadequate, i.e. incomplete implementation of the Law on Criminal Procedure.
Questionnaire
In the process of collecting data from trial monitoring, the monitors were provided with a tool, i.e. a questionnaire, which guided them within the system for processing the initial information and observations that were noted during their presence in the courtrooms.
Specifically, after having initially obtained the overall information from a particular hearing, based on 72 systematically arranged questions in the questionnaire, the monitors entered the collected data to an extent and in a manner that served the needs of the analysis.
The questionnaire itself was designed according to the sequence and manner of conducting criminal proceedings before a competent court, with particular focus on some of the new provisions, that is, introduced novelties in the Law on Criminal Procedure, along with provided tailored space where the personal cognitive perception of the monitors is entered.
GENERAL DATA
The monitoring system in the framework of this project covered the whole territory of the country, that is, the four appellate regions, with special focus on the courts in Skopje (Basic Court Skopje 1), Veles, Bitola, Shtip, Tetovo, Kumanovo and Kochani and targeted 450 court hearings or 372 criminal cases.
The total number of monitored trials included monitoring of 198 hearings or 152 cases in the Basic Court Skopje 1; 33 hearings and equivalent number of cases in the Basic Court Veles, 14 hearings concerning 12 cases in the Basic Court Kumanovo, and 71 hearings resulting from 57 cases in the Basic Court Tetovo, in the Basic Court Bitola, the number of monitored hearings was almost similar to the total number of monitored cases; 29 hearings were monitored concerning 23 cases in the Basic Court Shtip; and finally, the number of monitored hearings in the Basic Court Kochani largely overlapped with the number of cases, i.e. 16 hearings in 15 cases.
The respective statistics is presented in the Table below
Statistics on the number of monitored hearings against the number of cases.
Given the fact that the initial phase of this project overlapped with the beginning of the judicial administration (court clerks) strike, that lasted over half of the period envisaged for trial monitoring, the very dynamics of the monitoring activity was volatile, i.e. varied and reached its highest peaks once the strike ended.
Namely, as shown in the Table, one can note that the last 3 months of the monitoring process entail the largest number of hearings, i.e. September- 85, October- 91 and November- 161 hearings.
However, one can especially note the trend of hearings being held at the Basic Court Skopje 1 during the court administration strike.
Even though the court operation was at stand throughout the country and no hearings were held in most of the courts, i.e. the work was completely blocked; yet, that was not the case at the Basic Court Skopje 1.
In this court, some judges proceeded with work and held the scheduled hearings, and only small part of them demonstrated solidarity with the administration and discontinued the work; however, one should note that this refers to an insignificant number of judges.
Hearings per month
The data collected from the total number of hearings that were subject of monitoring throughout the country show that ⅓ of the hearings or 153 were postponed, 119 were completed in verdict, the indictment was withdrawn in 9 cases, the criminal proceedings were stayed in one hearing, whereas 168 hearings proceeded with procedural acts, as shown on the Chart below.
In realistic terms, this is a striking figure, especially given the fact that the number of postponed hearings in the two biggest appellate regions is clearly higher compared to the other regions.
Statistics on proceedings taken by courts
Based on the data, the postponement of hearings relies on several circumstances which are stipulated both in the Law on Criminal Procedure and beyond the law.
Namely, problems such as improper service of process, and failure of the parties and the witnesses and expert witnesses to appear in court hearings are singled out as topics that require further elaboration in order to advance and improve the system of securing the presence of the participants in the proceedings.
The statistics deriving from analysed data show that the postponement of hearings largely results from the absence of the defendant in the court proceedings – in 97 cases i.e. hearings, or due to the absence of the public prosecutor – 32 cases; absence of the defence attorney - 26 cases and incomplete panel of judges appointed on a specific case - 4 cases, however, one should not overlook the total number of 53 hearings when the postponement relied on “other grounds”.
One of the stated reasons for non-appearance of the defendants during the trial is the failure to bring them from the penitentiary facilities before the court.
In some cases, it results from lack of coordination with the registration system for transfer of detainees, while in other cases it results from technical difficulties (which is necessarily related to finances) for the detainee to be brought before court when the trial is held in cities outside the regions where the penitentiary institutions are located, while in some cases it results from overlapping with certain high profile court cases that practically leads to total blockage and dysfunction of the overall  system in a given court region (in this particular case, the Basic Court Skopje 1).
The legal provisions concerning the failure of the public prosecutor, i.e. private plaintiff to appear before the court clearly stipulate the essential role they have in the proceedings, despite this fact, public prosecutors failed to appear before the court in 32 cases or 32 hearings, which is a high percentage and accounts for 20% of the total number of postponed hearings.
This figure is further augmented by the number of 26 hearings where the defence attorney failed to appear.
This fact relies on the most prevalent reasons that defendants replace their defence attorneys and the concurrent obligations of defence attorneys in other cases, as well as the time required for the defence attorneys to study the facts and evidence of the respective case.
And finally, one reason for postponements under the category “other” refers to the failure of witnesses or expert witnesses to appear in court proceedings, as well as the need to present certain evidence, which is not yet provided or an expert report which is still not drafted.
In the instant case, total of 53 hearings were postponed under the category of reasons «other».
The Table below provides an overview of postponed court hearings by cities and the most frequent reasons thereof.
In view of the foregoing, this is one of the most striking problems that has been persistent in the past years in the judiciary.
The presented overview leads to the conclusion that the number of postponements is proportional to the size of the cities where the monitoring was conducted; hence, all the listed options for postponements in the questionnaire were exhausted in Skopje and Bitola, unlike smaller cities such as Veles and Kochani.
One thing that stands out, as shown in the Table below, is the defendant’s absence as reason for postponement in Skopje and Bitola, along with the absence of the public prosecutor (higher % in Skopje).
Reasons for postponement per city
In view of the monitoring data from the previous year, the data for this year do now indicate an upward trend, but quite the opposite, the statistics for both the previous and this year, shows 86 that  ⅓ of monitored hearings were postponed, which means that it poses a problem that may not be overlooked, but would require the adoption of legal solutions along with preventive mechanisms in order to improve the court proceedings.
Whether that would entail improved cooperation among the judicial authorities and those in charge of bringing detainees before courts, as quite often the absence of the defendant is not a fault on the part of the court, or whether that would mean more consistent application of the legal provisions pertaining to sanctioning the parties that fail to appear in court, such as the public prosecution office in the present case, the necessity for improved solutions has become increasingly obvious.
Based on the data from the conducted monitoring, the crimes committed in 450 hearings out of the total number of monitored hearings, mainly refer to the following chapters: «Crimes against property», «Crimes against life and body» as well as «Crimes against public transport safety».
Most common crimes were “Grand theft” and “Theft” in 60 and 38 of the monitored hearings, respectively, then “Bodily injury” in 40 hearings, “Endangered safety” in 20 hearings as well as “Endangered traffic safety” in 23 and «Severe crimes against the security of people and property in traffic» in 22 of the monitored hearings.
Number of criminal acts
From the total of 450 monitored hearings throughout the year, the monitors registered a number of 815 defendants that appeared in before the court for cases involving only one defendant or several defendants, reaching up to number of 37 defendants in one single case.
Number of hearings
Article 71 and Article 74 of the Law on Criminal Procedure stipulate the right to defence attorney.
According to the law, any individual who is suspected of or charged with a crime shall have the right to a defence attorney throughout the whole criminal procedure taken against him/her.
Prior to the first examination or any other proceedings specified in the  LCP are taken, the defendant shall be advised of his/her right to a defence attorney of his/her choice who can be consulted as well as that the defence attorney can be present during the examination.
However, in cases when the defendant is mute, deaf, or lacks the capacity to successfully defend him/herself or criminal proceeding are undertaken against the defendant for a crime which is punishable with a life sentence according to law, a defence attorney must be present at the very first examination.
According to the law, a defence attorney is necessary when detention is foreseen or imposed, that is, throughout the whole detention period.
In a situation when defence is mandatory and the accused fails to provide his/her defence attorney, the president of the court shall appoint an ex officio defence attorney for the further course of the proceedings, until the verdict becomes effective.
The following statistics derives from the data collected throughout the monitoring process:  276 accused individuals hired their own defence attorneys, 38 accused individuals were appointed an ex officio defence attorney and 108 accused individuals had no defence attorney.
Number of hearings in which the defendant had a defence attorney
Number of hearings in which the defendant had a defence attorney appointed ex-officio
Number of hearings in which the defendant didnot have a defence attorney
The Law on Criminal Procedure prescribes 4 types of summary proceedings:  1) summary proceedings for cases where a fine or imprisonment sentence up to 5 years is imposed, 2) proceedings in which a verdict is reached based on a plea agreement between the public prosecutor and the defendant, including the bargaining on the imposed sanction, 3) mediation proceedings where a specialized third party takes part - mediator, and 4) proceedings for issuing a penal notice proposing and prescribing a certain sanction when sufficient evidence of committed crimes exist, which is under the competence of a trial judge.
Having in mind that the monitors from the Coalition “All For Fair Trials” are allowed to access and attend only proceedings held in the court, i.e. public hearings, in addition to the regular proceedings, there was an opportunity to attend only one of the summary proceedings.
Accordingly, the collected data include 129 held regular proceedings or this accounts for 30% of all monitored hearings and 305 summary proceedings, which accounts for 70% of the hearings held.
Type of proceeding
MAIN TRIAL
Pursuant to the Law on Criminal Procedure, when the judge or the panel ascertains that all individuals required to attend the main trial are present, i.e. whether the trial can be held in the absence of some of the summoned persons, the court instructs the parties at the main trial to make the opening statements.
The process is conducted in successive order, i.e. the plaintiff- public prosecutor is given the opportunity to make the opening statement, followed by the defence attorney, i.e. defendant.
In view of this part of the procedure, once this legal instrument started to apply, the parties are given the opportunity to disclose decisive facts that they intend to prove, to list the evidence that they will present in a later phase and to determine the questions that will be discussed.
However, LCP distinguishes between the acts undertaken by the court and the application of this legal instrument both in regular and summary proceedings.
Namely, in regular proceedings, the above mentioned principle of making an opening statement is a rule, according to which the defence is always entitled not to make an opening statement, in summary proceeding, which cover over 80 % of the court cases, and entail crimes which are punishable with imprisonment sentence of up to 5 years, the opening statements of the public prosecutors transform into presentation of the indictment’s content, whereas the law does not foresee the contribution of the defence in respect of putting forward decisive facts in favour of the defence.
Even though the opening statements are not legally binding in summary proceedings, they are often utilized also by the defence attorneys.
Based on the processed data resulting from this monitoring exercise, there were a total number of 122 opening statements made by the public prosecutor, 59 by the defence attorney and 37 by the defendant.
The Table below shows the application of this legal instrument both in regular and summary proceedings.
One specific aspect that stands out is that in regular proceedings, on several occasions, the defence attorneys exercised their right not to make an opening statement, or specifically in 7 of the monitored cases.
Even though it is not specified for the summary proceedings, in almost 30% of cases, defence attorneys made opening statements, as shown in the graph below.
Opening statements
As part of the questionnaire, the monitors were tasked to assess, based on their individual perception, whether the opening statements disclose the decisive facts that will be further discussed and proved in the proceedings by the respective party making the opening statement.
Accordingly, the following data were obtained: -the public prosecutor’s opening statements were clear in 49% of the hearings, unclear in  23% of the proceedings and in 28% of the hearings the opening statements only partially revealed what was presented and will be proved by the public prosecutor;-the opening statements made by the defence attorney were clear in 77% of the hearings, unclear in 8% of the hearings, whereas 15% of the opening statements only partially revealed the facts that the defence i.e. defence attorney will further prove;-the opening statement made by the defendant was clear in 35% of the hearings, unclear in 6% of the hearings, and 59% of the opening statements only partially revealed the facts given by the defendant.
As a result, the data which were in this way obtained concerning the opening statements, undoubtedly show that defence attorneys make more clear and precise opening statements compared to the public prosecutors, furthermore, the high percentage of partially clear facts and evidence referred to by the defendants are indicative of the need for hiring a professional, that is, a defence attorney, that would represent the defendant’s interests and from the very beginning of the proceedings would portray a clear picture to the court about the intentions to propose evidence and about the case theory that will be elaborated.
Yet, one has to note that some of the opening statements made by the defendants, according to the monitors’ questionnaires, were made in the presence of their defence attorneys.
Furthermore, one must underline the detected inconsistency in the work of public prosecutors from the aspect of reducing the opening statement to a “plain” reading of the indictment, without presenting the theory of the case or the thesis that will be represented, and the way of distinguishing the legal elements that will be discussed in order to prove the grounds of the indictment.
Based on the processed data, the statistics shows that in over 70% of cases where the opening statements were made by the public prosecutor, it was reduced to plain reading of the indictment, rather than a more detailed explanation of what may be derived thereof.
Having made such opening statements, neither the court is clear what will the public prosecutor aim to prove, nor the defence is clear about the prosecutor’s thesis on the substantiation of the indictment or the plan to prove it.
GUILTY PLEA
The monitors attended 95 hearings in which the defendant pleaded guilty.
On this occasion, an analysis is conducted on the data obtained from the monitors regarding the legality of the guilty plea, the role of the court and the parties during the guilty plea process, as well as certain circumstances of guilty plea that concern some specific instruments in the criminal procedure and have immediate impact on the justification and legality of guilty plea.
Therefore, analysis is conducted on the data which refer to imposed detention at hearings when the defendant pleaded guilty, as well as the quantity of presented evidence by the court in determining the type and extent of criminal sanction under conditions of guilty plea during the first hearing of the main trial.
The Table below shows the trend of submission of guilty pleas, that is, out of the total number of 450 monitored hearings and 153 postponed, the monitors attended 95 hearings in which the defendant pleaded guilty.
Compared to the total number of hearings held (168), one can draw the conclusion that data concerning the guilty pleas made by defendants are considered as especially relevant data for drawing conclusions.
Moreover, out of the total number of analysed verdicts – 119, almost 95 verdicts were reached by guilty plea.
Guilty plea and type of criminal proceedings
Based on the obtained data, one can draw the conclusion that the instrument of guilty plea is put in place and has begun to take root in the national system of criminal justice.
Moreover, this instrument is also recognised by the parties in the criminal proceedings as an efficient tool for rapid, efficient and effective completion of criminal proceedings.
An additional argument for the increased application of this instrument may be the data from monitored trials in the previous year when guilty plea was made in 70 cases out of 550 hearings monitored in total, compared to this year, there is an increase of over one third, that is, defendants pleaded guilty at the main trial in 95 cases out of 450 hearings monitored, in total.
However, from the analysis of the basic courts’ annual reports1, the application of guilty plea is not made in the same extent as in the monitored cases, even though one can conclude that this instrument is applied with increased frequency.
Pleading guilty in summary proceedings
In view of the applicability, an additional argument is the fact that based on the analysed data, obtained by the monitors, this instrument is largely applied in summary proceedings, which accounts for around 85% of the cases, or for crimes which are punishable with up to 5 years of imprisonment.
These data support the thesis that courts feel safer to apply this instrument for minor crimes, while considered in correlation with the data obtained from the annual court reports, as well as the data obtained by the trial monitors, one can draw the conclusion that this instrument is not frequently applied for more serious crimes.
The data only confirm that it concerns a new instrument and the courts, understandably, have certain reservation to apply it in relation to more serious crimes.
Concerning the geographical distribution of the guilty plea in relation to the total number of monitored hearings, one can note that guilty plea was registered, in general, in almost one fifth of the monitored hearings, which accounts for 20% of monitored hearings.
Basic Court Skopje 1 and Basic Court Tetovo deviate from this trend.
Thus, one can notice the lowest number of monitored hearings in the Basic Court Skopje in which the defendant pleaded guilty, which accounts for 16% of the total number of monitored hearings, whereas guilty plea  was more frequent at the Basic Court Tetovo, that is,  in one third of monitored cases, which accounts for 38% of all monitored hearings.
Admission of guilt per criminal act
As to the type of crimes to which the defendants were willing to plead guilty, in general, it concerns a wide range of crimes.
If compared to the statistical yearbooks on crime movement, one can draw the conclusion that the defendants were generally willing to plead guilty to all crimes; or in other words, the trend of pleading guilty corresponds to the trend of crimes which are processed before the basic courts.
The majority of guilty pleas refer to crimes against the life and body, prop-erty and public traffic safety.
This is followed by crimes against the official position, sexual morality and sexual freedom.
Based on the data, one can discern the fact that pleading guilty during the main trial does not depend on the type of crime.
Generally, this is a positive conclusion as one cannot detect any selection in the guilty plea in relation to the type of crime.
In this context, an additional conclusion derives from the thesis that the willingness of the defendants to plead guilty depends on the extent to which the case and the criminal incident were investigated by the law enforcement agencies, i.e. the extent to which the indictment was substantiated.
The graphs below concern the analysis of the procedural rules on admissibility and legality of guilty plea.
Pursuant to the obligation deriving from Article 74 of the LCP that a defence attorney must attend when the defendant pleads guilty, the data, obtained from the monitors and further analysed, show that defence attorneys were present in all of the cases.
Were questions posed to check the admission of guilt made by the defendant
Concerning the data related to verification of all elements of a particular crime, one can conclude that when judges reviewed the guilty plea statement, the defendant was largely advised about the charges and what s/he had pleaded guilty for.
Nevertheless, there is a still persistent practice, despite the minimal improvements compared to the previous year (87% against 82%), that judges only read the indictment to the defendant, or provide explanation about the process of determining the type  and extent of criminal sanction, according to the provisions of the Law on Determining the Type and Extent of Criminal Sanction.
Therefore, one can draw the conclusion that the judges should dedicate more attention to the defendant as well as his/her defence attorney, with regard to the request for providing adequate legal aid to their clients; in the explanation about the legal elements of the crime; the prosecutorial evidence to corroborate the legal elements of the crime; and the manner of commission of the respective crime.
The court should be entirely convinced that the defendant had committed the respective crime as provided in the indictment; that is, the specific crime to which the defendant pleaded guilty in the course of the main trial.
It is therefore considered inadmissible that the court has adopted a practice to read the indictment or as entered in one of the monitors’ questionnaires - the defendant pleaded guilty, but the respective crime had not been committed as presented in the indictment.
Any such opposing by the defendant or correction made by the defendant concerning the indictment during the pleading of guilt should not have been accepted by the court as a voluntary admission of guilt for a given crime, as stated in the indictment and the court should have dismissed it and proceeded with the main trial as if no guilty plea had been made, pursuant to the provisions in Articles 381 and 334 of the LCP.
Were questions posed to check whether the defendant madethe admission of guilt of his/her own free will?
An interesting fact is that in 13% of the monitored hearings, where the defendant pleaded guilty, the monitors could note some inconsistency as regards the free will to plead guilty.
That is, in 11 cases, the defendant did not plead guilty of own free will or he/she had certain reservations; however, the court failed to take those reservations into account and accepted such flawed guilty plea.
Needless to say that such practice adopted by the court should be eradicated, especially in respect of the court›s role in the plea hearing or plea bargaining proceedings, as it assumes the role of guarantor and protector of the defendant’s rights.
Such practice stimulates the wrongful application of the guilty plea, and shows tolerance for the tactics of the authorised plaintiff to find a scapegoat with the aim to complete the processing of the cases through the court labyrinths, but failing to take account of either the real perpetrator of the crime, or the safeguards of justice.
Were questions posed to check the defendant’s awarenessof the consequences from the admission of guilt?
The same is the percentage of cases where the monitors took note of the lack of awareness on the part of the defendant regarding the admission of guilt.
The monitors detected cases where the court failed to pay any attention to the opposing on the part of the defendant during the guilty plea, which can lead to the conclusion that such admission of guilt was extorted.
The monitors provided interesting data that in one particular case, the court directly advised the defendant to plead guilty so that the public prosecution avoids to file an indictment against an older close relative, on whose behalf the electricity meter was recorded, concerning a case in which the defendant was charged with the crime – theft of electricity, pursuant to Article 235-a of the Criminal Code.
In these cases, instead of acting in the interest of justice and showing impartiality, the judges had predetermined position in relation to the defendant›s guilt, irrespective of his defence and failed to take into account the presumption of innocence of the defendant.
Despite the slight improvements compared to the previous year, it is of major concern that there are persistent cases in which the court, instead of being a passive arbitrator in assessing the defendant’s free will and awareness about the admission of guilt, the court still actively represents the interests of one of the parties, which is also contrary to the interests of the justice.
In this context, one can arrive at the conclusion about the need to provide additional training for judges, concerning the proactive protection of justice under conditions of admission of guilt during the main trial that is, increasing their active role in the process of assessing the admission of guilt.
This role brings it closer to the role of the court within the mixed criminal proceedings.
In other words, in order to determine whether the defendant made a guilty plea of one’s own will and with full awareness about any consequences thereof, the court can and should be active, as well as inquisitive in assessing the admission of guilt, in such a manner as requesting additional evidence or statements from the defendant in order to ensure complete disclosure and clarification of the criminal event and be fully convinced that the defendant committed the admitted crime.
Was there any evidence presented after the admission of guilt?
Finally, apart from examining the awareness and free will under which the admission of guilt is made, the court is to assess whether the guilty plea is corroborated by evidence.
Accordingly, Article 381, paragraph 3 of the LCP stipulates the court’s obligation to verify whether the admission of guilt is supported by evidence, i.e. during the main trial, the court shall only present evidence that leads to determining the type and extent of criminal sanction.
Based on the data obtained by the monitors, one may conclude that the specific part of the proceedings aimed to assess the defendant’s admission of guilt is most “vulnerable” in view of prevention of any false testimonies.
Based on the data, it is obvious that the court presents insufficient corroborating evidence for the admission of guilt, and the verdict is largely based on the statement, i.e. the admission of guilt by the defendant.
The monitors noted that only in nine hearings there was corroborating evidence presented concerning the determination of the type and extent of criminal sanction.
Moreover, an additional problem lies in the fact that in one half of these hearings, i.e. five of them, the only evidence presented by the court was the defendant’s prior conviction.
Therefore, it is needless to elaborate how questionable is the prior conviction as prima facie evidence.
This is for the simple reason that recidivism, i.e. prior conviction, itself cannot suffice as ground to determine the criminal life style of an individual.
Any prior conviction should be analysed from the aspect of the type of crime and the respective conviction, the time elapsed from the prior conviction until the admission of guilt, and the respective life style of the defendant.
It is considered impossible to determine a more severe penalty by applying a simple mathematical operation and calculate the prior convic-tion as nine points5.
Having regard to the presented data, one can arrive at the conclusion about the necessity of having the court to undertake an active role during the evidentiary hearing; that is, to be authorised to request the parties to provide evidence of appropriate quantity and quality, in order to accept the admission of guilt as righteous and fair, and determine the adequate sanction accordingly.
The reasons why evidence is presented in this manner cannot be identified only with the role of the court, but also with some inconsistencies in the LCP.
According to the LCP, evidence is proposed by the parties, and following the defendant’s guilty plea, the court has insight only in the list of evidence that will be presented during the evidentiary hearing in support of the indictment (Article 321, paragraph 2 of the Law on Criminal Procedure - LCP).
The court, therefore, has no knowledge in advance whether any of the listed evidence may be in favour of the guilty plea and to which extent the respective evidence can contribute to the determination of the type and extent of sanction.
Moreover, there is a prevailing dilemma, whether any of the parties would be interested in complete disclosure of the evidence through the extensive methods of direct and cross examination of witnesses under conditions when the defendant pleaded guilty.
Accordingly, the LCP would require certain reforms, in the context of modification of the previsions that regulate the main hearing, in such a manner that would accept the “originary” solution from the American criminal justice system that is, holding a separate sentencing hearing.
Such a hearing would eliminate the dilemmas which the local courts are confronted with, due to the existing provisions of the LCP which fail to provide efficient means for presenting evidence in support of the guilty plea and determining the most appropriate sanction, therefore, the court relies only on very simple evidence, that is, prior conviction records, and also relies on the already questionable6 provisions of the Law on Determining the Type and Extent of Criminal Sanction.
In respect of the question “Did the defence attorney have enough time to advise the defendant?”, the monitors had the possibility to make an assessment only in one third of monitored hearings in which the defendant pleaded guilty.
Based on the data from 31 answers, the monitors noted that in 94% of the cases that the defendant had enough time to consult  his/her defence attorney, whereas in 6% it was noted that the defendant did not consult his/her defence attorney or he had no sufficient time to consult his/her defence attorney.
Nevertheless, one cannot consider these data as problematic for a simple reason - if the defendant already had a defence attorney during the previous phases of the criminal proceedings, one can expect that the guilty plea had been already agreed upon and elaborated with his/her defence attorney.
This practice would become problematic in cases in which the defendant had no defence attorney, then decided to plead guilty, and only then hired an attorney or was appointed an ex officio attorney by the court.
In such cases, it is considered necessary that the court provides sufficient time to the defendant and the defence attorney, in order to enable the defence attorney to explain any consequences of the guilty plea to his/her client.
Moreover, if such remarks relate to this risky group in 6% of the hearings, any such practice of the court needs to be eradicated and should not be tolerated by any of the parties, irrespective of the fact that the acceptance of the defendant’s guilty plea by the court is in favour both of the defendant and his/her defence attorney, as well as the public prosecutor.
Such a practice is unlawful and contrary to the interests of justice.
DETENTION AND MEASURES FOR SECURING ATTENDANCE
Article 144 of the Law on Criminal Procedure provides the following measures for securing attendance: summons, precautionary measures, bail, arrest, deprivation of liberty, retention, short detention, home detention and detention.
In respect of the range of these measures, the monitors attended only 34 hearings in which the defendants were in detention (see table below), while milder measures for securing the attendance of defendants were applied in only 14 cases.
Based on the obtained data, there is a noticeable tendency for non-excessive use of detention by the court in the analysed and recorded cases by the monitors, or the measure of detention was applied in about 8% of the monitored cases.
However, having in mind the type of crimes for which the hearings were subject to monitoring, one can conclude that detention is not imposed only in small and insignificant percentage, compared to the other hearings.
There is a concern, as noted by the monitors, about the persistent practice of the courts not to provide appropriate explanation on the reasons to impose the measure of detention, or to provide realistic assessment of the underlying factors and register them in writing in the decision to continue the detention7.
In addition to imposing the detention measure, the monitors noted that milder measures for securing the attendance of defendants were applied by the court in only 26 cases (see the table below).
The monitors noted that these measures were imposed on the defendants in 14 cases; in two cases the measures were imposed on the other participants in the criminal proceedings, that is, the damaged party and the witness were forcibly brought on one occasion, whereas the milder measure - summons - was applied in the remaining 10 cases.
According to these data, it is inevitable to conclude that the court fails to take into account the alternatives to the most severe measure – detention - as the efficiency of such measures is already recognised in other more developed criminal justice systems.
In this context, the milder measures remain to be only a matter of normative style in our LCP, which are applied very rarely or not applied at all.
Regretfully, the same is true about the following measures: bail, home detention and most of the precautionary measures.
Accordingly, one needs to note the arguments for overlooking these measures, namely, there is lack of adequate mechanism for their application and control; the court does not dispose of appropriate tools that would provide convincing data that if applied, there will be sufficient guarantee that the defendant’s presence will be secured during the main hearings and that their application would exclude or reduce the risks for which the measures were applied.
Therefore, it is recommended that mechanisms for institutional support of the court need to be developed in order to ensure the application of milder measures that secure the attendance of the defendant in the course of criminal proceedings.
In this respect, such mechanisms are primarily seen from the aspect of developing the capacities of the Probation Services, which are established in accordance with the Law on Probation; introduction of changes and amendments to the Law on Probation that would incorporate the respective measures as competence of the probation services; as well as application of the LCP by imposing an ex officio obligation to the probation services to deliver the respective data to the court and generate risk assessments concerning the defendant, that would serve as ground on which the court would decide about the application of the most appropriate measure for securing the attendance of the defendant.
Finally, having regard to these recommendations, the court would be enabled to provide true and based on fact rationale in the decision to apply the measures for securing attendance.
In respect of assessing the legality of the procedure to apply these measures, one can conclude that apart from one case, the requirements of the LCP referring to the presence of the defence attorney when the measure of detention is imposed, were properly applied in all other cases.
Detention-without a defence attorney
On the other hand, based on the monitors’ analysis, one can commend the practice of the court (see the graph below) for having entirely fulfilled the procedural provisions on the obligatory attendance of a defence attorney under conditions when the detained person admitted the guilt.
Admission of guilt made with a defence attorney-detention
The observed practice of the court to fail to act in line with Article 173 of LCP is problematic, that is, according to this Article, detention is to be discontinued following the admission of guilt,  in cases when it had been imposed under conditions of existent justified risk that the defendant will hide, falsify or destroy the traces of the crime; or if there are special circumstances indicating that the defendant will obstruct the criminal proceedings by tempering with witnesses, expert witnesses, accomplices or those covering up criminal acts.
Or, despite the insignificant number of observed violations when the court acted contrary to the LCP in two of four noted cases, or specifically, it failed to discontinue the measure of detention once the defendant admitted the guilt, yet, any such cases require to be further analysed.
This is for a simple reason that being driven by the iura novit curia  principle, one can draw the conclusion that most probably detention in such cases was imposed on several grounds, and there was rational expectation on the part of the court that the other grounds for continuation of the measure of detention would persist, even though the defendant pleaded guilty.
However, despite of having accepted this argument, and as noted in this report, the existing problem still persists in respect of the factually instituted decisions to impose detention, that is, the frequent, uncritical and unsubstantiated imposing of detention on several grounds from Article 165 of LCP, as well as the noted problem concerning the rationale in the decisions to impose detention based on (in)appropriate facts and evidence, which also implies their (in)appropriate registration in the respective decisions.
Was the detention discontinued after making admission of guilt
Any other explanation concerning the monitors’ allegations would lead to the conclusion that the foregoing Roman legal principle is denied, which would further result in wrongful application of the LCP provisions.
Moreover, had the court taken this position in such cases, defence attorneys as well as public prosecutors, who are the guardians of legality, should not have tolerated any such action, i.e. it should have been challenged in appeal proceedings for a simple reason that such cases endanger the fundamental human right – right to liberty.
EVIDENTIARY PROCEEDINGS
The evidentiary proceeding, as part of the main hearing, is stipulated within the scope of Articles 382 to 394 of the LCP, and as such it is given a consecutive order in the law, as well as in the systematically arranged questionnaire of the Coalition, that is, after the defendant is advised about his/her rights and the option to plead guilty during the hearing.
There is a clearly prescribed order of presenting the evidence in this part of the proceedings.
Specifically, the first to be presented are the evidence related to the indictment and any property claims, followed by the evidence of the defence and possible prosecutorial evidence that would challenge any of the evidence presented by the defence, in the form of evidence in rebuttal, as well as the evidence of the defence in response to the such challenging, in the form of evidence in reply.
The Law on Criminal Procedure specifies 3 ways of examination - direct examination, cross-examination and re-direct and re-cross examination.
Direct examination is undertaken by the party that proposed the witness, the expert witness or the technical advisor; cross-examination is undertaken by the opposing party, whereas any additional examination is repeated by the party who called the witness or the expert witness, so that any questions posed during this examination are limited to the questions posed during the examination of the opposing party.
After the parties complete their examination, the chair of the judicial panel (and its members) may ask questions.
During the evidentiary proceedings, the role of the court is to exercise control over the manner and order of examining witnesses and expert witnesses as well as the presenting of evidence, and accordingly takes into account the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proceedings and the determination of truth.
In this part of the proceedings,  the court also  decides about any objections raised by the parties, whereby it can ban a certain question or answer to a question which had already been posed or if that is considered inadmissible or irrelevant for the case, or the respective question entails both the question and the answer, indeed, cross-examination is considered as an exception.
The data collected by the monitors show that there is strict adherence to the legal provisions in this respect, and only minimal exception of 1% was registered; that is, the monitors registered inconsistences in the legally prescribed order of presenting evidence in only 2 cases, which was explained on the ground of ensuring the cost-effectiveness of the proceeding.
However, what is being perceived as cost-effectiveness on the part of the court (in the respective 2 cases), in fact, entails the violation of the defendant’s rights which are specified in the LCP.
Was the order of presenting evidence in accordancewith the legally prescribed order?
One novelty that was introduced in the LCP and is currently being applied, refers to the application of paragraph 2 of Article 386, according to which the witness should take an oath before giving a testimony.
One should underline the fact that even though taking an oath is prescribed by law, the court is obliged to warn the witness about his/her duty to inform the court on any matters related to the case to the best of his/her knowledge, and advise the witness that any false testimony is a considered a serious offence.
Based on the available data, the novelty in the law is applied to a satisfactory extent by the court - 69%, however, irrespective of whether an oath was taken or not, the person who testifies may be held criminally responsible for giving false statements in the capacity of a witness and this may be the reason why such obligation is seen as non-obligatory.
In view of the LCP application, and especially the application of the introduced novelties, during the period of vacatio legis as well as once the LCP started to apply, numerous training were organized by the OSCE Mission to Skopje, the American Bar Association in cooperation with the Academy for Judges and Public Prosecutors and the Bar Association, yet, one can note the need for additional professional development of all actors in the proceedings.
In particular, this refers to the application of the provisions related to direct examination, cross-examination and re-cross and re-direct examination of witnesses which is due to the fact that the actors in the proceedings have not yet mastered the techniques which are required to apply the respective legal provisions.
The foregoing conclusion derives from the data collected in respect of the examination of witnesses.
The questions that were designed and included in the questionnaire and were used by the  monitors as  tool for sharing the experiences and the findings obtained in the court, also included a set of questions that precisely refer to the manner and techniques for different types of examination.
The questions entail the aspects of clarity, lack of ambiguity, the extent to which the parties in the proceedings have studied and become familiar with the case, as well as the technical rules that the court and the parties are to respect during the proceedings.
In respect of the part “Were the questions clear and precise during the direct examination of the witness or expert witness?”, the following data were obtained from 126 hearings in which direct examination was applied:
In respect of the question whether the party, who called the witness, left an impression of knowing what he/she was asking and can properly handle the case, we found that irrespective of whether the public prosecutor or the defence called the witness, both parties made the impression that they knew what they were asking and that they handled the case well, which can be seen in the graphs below.
Direct examination undertaken by
As to the court›s activity in the process of presenting evidence, it is stipulated that the role of the court is to exercise control over the manner and order of examining the witnesses, expert witnesses and the presentation of evidence, and accordingly the court takes into account the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proceedings, and the determination of truth, when necessary, but also takes care about the dignity of the parties and witnesses in the proceedings.
During the proceedings, the court can ban a certain question or answer which had already been answered, or if the question is considered as inadmissible or irrelevant; the court may also reject that certain evidence is presented if considered as unnecessary and of no relevance for the case, however; under no circumstances after the cross-examination, the court may not prevent the opposing party to cross-examine the witness.
This type of violation was observed in only 2% of the processed data.
As regards the cross-examination, the data indicate the necessity for further improvements by all actors in the proceedings.
Cross-examination is stipulated to be limited and to entail only questions that were previously asked by the party that proposed the witness.
Deviation from 106 this rule, which is stipulated in the LCP, was noticed in 18% of the monitored cases.
Specifically, in 88 hearings involving cross-examination, in 72 of them, which accounts for 82%, the cross-examination was limited to questions from the direct examination; however, this was not true in the remaining 18%.
There were registered cases when the judge directly reacted to questions which deviate from the concept of cross-examination, even though it is still questionable whether the judge has the right to ban a particular question without properly raised objection by the party in the proceedings.
In other cases, the parties failed to raise objections on the questions, and therefore they were subject of further explanation and reply.
Based on the collected data, it is a striking fact that the mechanism of cross-examination is more utilized by the defence attorneys than the prosecutors.
As shown in the graphs below (the horizontal line on the bottom of the graph shows the number of defendants in the proceeding), total of 64 persons were cross-examined by the public prosecution, and 104 persons were cross-examined by the defence attorneys.
The data lead to the conclusion that defence attorneys show more determination to utilize the available resources in order to put forward their defence strategy and prove the theory of the case in the interest of the defendants.
Another indicator of the need for improved application of the mechanism- cross-examination by the parties, relies on the fact that no closed questions were used in 31% of cross-examinations.
Furthermore, some interruptions were registered during the cross-examination, that is, 31% of the examination was not performed in a smooth and uninterrupted manner.
On the other hand, according to the monitors’ perception, the cross-examination was successful in 80% of cases.
With regard to the use of objections as tactical mechanism to defend one’s own strategy in a particular case, one can conclude that practically there is equal utilization of this mechanism by both the prosecution office and the defence.
However, if compared to the statistics from the analysis for the previous year when the use of objections by the public prosecution accounted for 22% of the cases and 11% on the part of the defence, this year there is a slight downward trend concerning the public prosecution office and upward trend concerning the defence.
That is, the public prosecution office used objections in 20% of hearings, whereas the defence used objections in 15% of hearings, which, in fact, implies that the utilization of this mechanism is brought closer.
Use of objections in the course of the proceeding
As previously mentioned, the possibility for the court to ask questions in order to clarify certain facts and inconsistencies in the statements is not completely removed, but one has to bear in mind the old Law on Criminal Procedure where such possibility was an exclusive right of the court; that is, it was the court that asked questions, while the parties could pose questions once the examination was completed in order to establish some missing facts.
The court is now given the possibility to pose questions as soon as both parties in the proceeding have completed their examinations; however, such possibility should not be transformed into a separate examination.
The graph below enables us to analyse the possibility for the court to pose questions, which illustrates that the court has been largely utilizing the additional mechanism for posing questions, i.e. in 48 of the monitored proceedings, which accounts for 42% of all monitored proceedings.
Does the court exercise its right to pose questions to the witness/expert?
Some questionnaires include that judges have shifted this possibility into an entirely separate examination of witnesses/experts.
Obviously, the old habits which were deeply rooted in the previous system are being still applied, despite the diametrical changes of the overall system of court proceed-ings.
With respect to Article 388, paragraph 2 of LCP, i.e. exception to direct presentation of evidence, according to which the statements made by witnesses during the investigation  and the statements collected by action of the defence  during the investigation,  can be used in cross-examination or to challenge the presented findings or as evidence in rebuttal, for the purpose of evaluating the authen-ticity of the statements given during the main hearing,  the monitors found that this exception was not 108 largely  applied.
However, for certain percentage or  18% of cases where this exception was applied, this was undertaken due to inconsistent statements or due to reminding the witness about already giv-en statement in order to discredit the witness, that is, when the statement given in direct examination deviated from the previously given statement.
In addition, in lower percentage of the hearings, i.e. 8% of the monitored hearings, the public prosecutor gave a proposal for reading the statement that the witness or the defendant made in a preliminary procedure.
With regard to the examination of the defendant in the proceedings, one has to underline that in accordance with Article 391, paragraph 1 of the LCP, the defendant shall be examined on the proposal of the defence.
The introduction of this provision in the law means complete aban-doning of the principle for automatic examination of the defendant only based on the need of the prosecution office to prove the indictment.
Having abandoned this system of  examination, now the defendant is enabled not to be examined in the proceedings, but rather it  relies on the disposition of the defence, which is contrary to the previous provisions according to which the defendant should have used the right to remain silent in a situation when s/he considers that no statement should be made, which in return creates a different image of the defendant, most often that s/he is guilty and early conclusions are reached by the court both for the defendant and his/her actions.
When the defence makes a proposal that the defendant should be examined, the exam-ination during the hearing is carried out according to the applicable rules which are valid for examination of witnesses, i.e. expert witnesses with respect to particular types of examinations, whereby the defendant may not refuse to answer any questions that are posed according to the concept for cross-examination.
The statistics obtained from the data collected this year, shows that in 65% of the monitored hearings the defendant was examined, which is an upward trend compared to the data from pre-vious years, that is, 53% in 2015 and 50% in 2014, respectively.
FAIR TRIAL – equality of arms
With respect to the evaluation of the equality of arms between the parties, one can conclude that the monitors preserved the same position as in the previous years.
On the question “Were the parties equally treated by the court and whether the defence was given the same opportunities as the public prosecution office in the process of proposing evidence?” the monitors provided high percentage of affirmative answers - 99%.
According to the answers, the monitors provided negative answers in only three, i.e. two cases, as illustrated on the graph below.
Were the defence and the public prosecutor equally treated by the court?
In this context, one can conclude that during the main hearing, when the parties are afforded the possibility to oppose before the court, the court largely equally treats the parties, that is, gives them equal opportunity to propose evidence.
In addition, the identified remarks in the sense of restricting the right to equality of arms, most probably derive from the unequal opportunities given to the parties, primarily in the course of the preliminary proceedings, that is, when evidence is collected, so by analogy, if the parties are not able to collect certain evidence during the investigation, there is no possibility to propose that such evidence is presented during the main hearing.
In fact, in this way, the problems related to the equality of arms between the parties, which is part of the fair trial principle, can be possibly disguised if the analysis is made only from the aspect of the role of the court in the course of the main hearing.
Was the defence given the same opportunities as the publicprosecution office in respect of proposing evidence?
Public trial right/principle
With regard to the publicity, as one of the fundamental principles of court proceedings, one can conclude that any significant inconsistencies in the application of provisions of the LCP were not noticed by the monitors.
Also, the monitors concluded that in cases where the public was excluded, that was undertaken in compliance with the provisions of the LCP.
One interesting fact in terms of protecting the right to public trials is the obvious inactivity when it comes to having publicly announced the time and cases brought before the courts.
As this matter is concerned, one can notice a constant downturn, compared to the previous year, when the time and the place of the trials were not announced before the courtroom in only 12% of the monitored cases, this year, the trend is further enhanced and accounts for almost 20% of the analysed cases.
The reasons for such weakening of the right of the public to be informed about the place and time of court proceedings in the court buildings can be identified with the poor maintenance of the notice boards in the courts; there is poor planning about the regular maintenance of the notification systems in the Judicial budget or the court administration units lack adequate understanding of the relevance of timely notification about action taken before the court, so that they overlook the obligation during the ongoing exercising of the judicial competencies.
Were the place and time of the trial publically announcedon the notice board outside the courtroom?
Impartiality right/principle
The principle of court’s impartiality is one of the essential principles as part of the right to fair trial and fair proceedings.
The analysis whether this principle is protected in the court proceedings was based on a set of questions concerning the judicial disqualification, which is, in fact, one mechanisms under conditions when the partiality of the court towards some of the parties is recognized.
Throughout the monitoring, the monitors did not witness any cases when the parties requested the judge to be disqualified.
The data lead to the conclusion that the court adequately applied and gave due attention to the provisions of the LCP, which stipulate when a judge must be disqualified, as well as that the court appropriately conducted the proceedings without any grounds for suspicion of its partiality, which can be a ground for optional disqualification of judges (recusal).
Interestingly enough, in seven proceedings the monitors noted that the judges had already formed opinion with regard to the case.
In particular, the data show that these figures are continuously on the increase in the last three years, that is, from only two registered cases two years ago, it increased to five cases last year and finally, seven registered cases in this year.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that this is usually the case when the defendant had already pleaded guilty.
Despite the insignificant number of such registered case, i.e. seven hearings out of total of 450 monitored hearings, yet, such practice poses a certain concern because instead of having the court actively assess the guilty plea, there is a situation where the court hardly waits for the admission in order to have its position towards the defendant verified.
Moreover, such cases would also require that the role of the defence attorney is re-evaluated, i.e. whether and how was the client advised about the admission of guilt.
When the court has taken such a role, the overall guarantee and safeguard mechanisms of the courts’ image become highly questionable.
One possibility to abandon this situation is the prospective future reform of the LCP provisions by introduction of a special sentencing hearing, and in such case some additional evidence will have to be presented before the court that would confirm the guilt on the part of the defendant, which was previously discerned by the court through the defendant’s admission of guilt.
Based on the data, one can conclude that the court was biased in five cases, whereas the defendant was intimidated in two cases.
Such intimidation, as was additionally explained by the monitors, was detected through the way in which the court, while explaining the provisions of the Law on Determining the Type and Extent of Criminal Sanction, used wording that stimulated the defendant’s admission of guilt and put strong emphasis on the fact that admission of guilt implies a milder sanction as opposed to the having held the main hearing which would result in more severe sanction.
In such cases, one can consider it probable that the court delivered inappropriate wording for the purpose of somehow assisting the defendant, while giving explanation about the consequences from the admission of guilt.
Yet, such practice of the courts should be minimized and eliminated through appropriate training of judges.
In order to avoid the practice of the court to give indications about the consequences from the admission of guilt, which may be further interpreted both by the defendant or other actors in the proceedings that the court is in favour of the admission of guilt.
In this way, the admission of guilt would only result from the free will of the defendant and would be void of any burdens from initiatives or subtle pressures on the part of the court.
As far as the additional training for judges is concerned, a particular accent should be put on training the judges about the communication of the court with the clients, given the fact that improper ex-parte communication can largely create an impression about the (im)partiality of the court both for the defendant and the general public.
Such impression was created based on the 112 fact that the monitors registered this practice in 12 hearings, which implies a significant increase, compared to the previous year, when such communication was registered in only 5 cases.
Was there improper ex-parte communication?
The reasons for the necessity of additional trainings for judges rely on the fact that under conditions of improper ex-parte communication, the court runs the risk to be recognized as closer to some of the parties, whereby the general public no longer has impression that the court is impartial.
Also, sometimes defence attorneys make an attempt and/or abuse the improper communication with the court so as to present themselves before the clients as having close relations/contacts with the judges, and justify the promises that they  had made to the clients, even though not always realistic, regarding the outcome of the criminal proceedings.
Presumption of innocence
Presumption of innocence is closely related to matters of partiality and all other previously analysed aspects.
This year, unlike the previous year, the situation has deteriorated when viewed from the aspect of the data observed by the monitors.
The monitors registered that the defendant’s right to presumption of innocence was violated in eight cases, which accounts for 3%, and there is a triple increase compared to the previous year when it accounted for only 1% of the cases11.
Was there anything suggesting that the principle of presumptionof innocence was not respected?
This conclusion, viewed in relation to other data on the court’s impartiality, where the mon-itors found that the court was biased in seven cases, and the defendant’s right to presumption of innocence was violated in eight cases, can point to the conclusion that in all of the registered cases, the court was biased to the detriment of the defendant.
No comments are needed in terms of which would be the effects deriving from this conclusion.
Therefore, it is deemed necessary that additional training is delivered for the judges with respect to their role in assessing the defendant’s admission of guilt during the court proceedings.
However, a dose of optimism is instilled by the low number of registered cases, which is why one can conclude that this is not a widespread phenomenon among the judges and therefore, it can be easily thwarted and eliminated.
Right to defence
The right to defence was analysed in a set of questions, mainly in respect of advising the defendant about his/her rights, defence attorneys’ efficiency to realise the theory of the case during the main hearing, the access of the defence to the overall evidence, the appropriate time for preparation, and possible restrictions on this right or/and restrictions on the right of the defendants held in detention to communicate with their defence attorneys.
As to the efficiency of the right to defence, our monitors noted that in 19 cases, which accounts for 12% of the answers to the question, defence attorneys were not equal to the task in terms of ensuring efficient and professional defence to their clients.
In that context, even though it concerns a low percentage from the total number of monitored cases, it is deemed our duty to note that defence attorneys, and the Bar as a professional organisation, are obliged to ensure continuous education and development of the professional standards for the members.
Therefore, there will be a need to provide analysis on continuous basis concerning the efficiency and professionalism of the defence attorneys12 , in particular, under conditions when the adversarial system is put in place, and when their professionalism becomes especially apparent during the main hearing, while the outcome of the criminal proceedings largely depends on the defence.
This fact is supported by an additional argument, which poses a concern, that compared to the previous year there is an upward trend, that is from 6%13 to 12% in the analysed completed questionnaires.
Furthermore, our primary consideration refers to the appropriate formulation of the case theory of the defence, the proposing of appropriate evidence, and the active role of the defence to challenge the prosecutorial evidence by cross-examination and the practice of raising objections to the court so that prosecutor’s questions during the witness testimony are overruled by the court.
Regarding the efficiency of the defence, the defence attorneys, in a defensive manner, often put forward arguments based on the lack of sufficient time to prepare their own defence or that they were confronted with certain restrictions in the contact with their clients.
Such inconsistencies were registered in four cases.
With regard to the problems that defence attorneys face in the provision of effective and efficient defence to their clients, traditionally, they claim that they have restricted access to all the evidence available to the public prosecution office (in 6 cases); that the prosecution fails to deliver the evidence to the defence (in 3 cases); and in other 5 cases in which defence attorneys were denied this right.
One can notice that this year, there is drastic increase in the number of complaints from defence attorneys, that is, from two registered case in the previous year, up to fourteen registered cases this year, or a sevenfold increase.
Were there reactions on the part of the defence because
Accordingly, this can be understood that the desired objectives of the criminal procedure reform15  , put in place through the adoption of the LCP in 2013, have not appropriately echoed in practice; and by making an analogy, one should consider certain modifications of the LCP provisions that would incorporate the safeguard mechanisms for the defence attorneys, so that the obligation to allow the defence attorneys access to all prosecutorial evidence would be enhanced.
This can be made feasible through introduction of a ban to present evidence which was not delivered to the defence and is deemed detrimental to the defendant, or through introduction of an obligation to present evidence which is beneficial for the defence, but the defence claims that even though the public prosecution office is in possession of that evidence, yet it was not delivered to the defence.
Also, the practice of giving limited access of the defence to certain evidence should be prohibited, because no copying, recording or transcripts are allowed.
This refers to cases when the evidence is presented to the defence only in the premises of the public prosecution office, with no possibility for the defence attorney to copy or make transcripts of the evidence, or this activity is further burdened with inappropriately high costs for copying or electronic multiplication on another electronic device for data transfer.
Also, it is considered essential that deadlines, specified in the law, need to be changed and extended - according to which the defendant and defence attorney during the investigation have the right to submit certain documents, evidence or request the public prosecutor to undertake certain investigation and secure certain evidence, in respect of paragraph 4 of Article 302 of LCP, as well as that special deadline should be determined for the main hearing, meaning that the defendant and his/her defence attorney would have sufficient time to prepare the defence concerning the newly obtained evidence by the public prosecution office.
PRONOUNCING AND ANNOUNCING THE VERDIT
Once all the evidence is presented, namely, the evidentiary and main hearings are completed, according to the LCP, the provisions referring to the verdict are successively applied.
Three types of verdicts are stipulated in our Law on Criminal Procedure: rejecting – meaning that the indictment was rejected, not guilty – meaning that the defendant was acquitted, and guilty – meaning that the defendant was convicted/found guilty.
The trial monitors from the Coalition “All for Fair Trials” did not detect any rejecting and not-guilty verdicts; however, they came across situations when the indictment was withdrawn by the public prosecutor in the course of the proceeding.
The indictment was withdrawn in 9 of the monitored cases, that is, in 3 cases where the crime “Bodily Injury” was the ground for prosecu-tion, in 2 cases “Grand Theft” and the remaining for the following crimes “Coercion”, “Endangered Safety”, “Severe Crimes against the Safety of  People and Property in Traffic” and “Providing Public Transport Services without License”.
Indictments withdrawn based on the type of crime
According to the provisions of the LCP, once the verdict is pronounced, it must be immediately announced in public, when the court is not able to pronounce the verdict the same day after the completion of the main hearing, the announcement of the verdict may be delayed for a period not longer than 3 days.
It is stipulated that the court announces the verdict (chair of the judicial panel or sole judge) in the presence of the parties, their legal representatives, proxies, defence attorneys, by publically reading the enacting part of the verdict and stating the reasoning thereof.
In a brief explanation, the court makes reference to the criminal act the defendant «is charged with» and already convicted for (with the verdict), as well as to the evidence presented.
According to the processed monitoring data, it is shown that the verdict was publically an-nounced in 74% of cases, unlike in 26% of the cases when the verdict was not publically announced, also, the data show that when the verdict was pronounced at the hearing, in 41 cases or hearings the court made reference to the criminal act and the evidence, in 3 cases it made a partial reference, whereas in 9 hearings the court made no reference at all.
Compared to the statistics obtained for the needs of similar analysis in the previous year, one can note an upward trend in the percentage of verdicts that were not publically pronounced and announced.
Specifically, based on the data from the previous year, the court publically announced the verdict in 88% of cases and in 12% of cases the court failed to do so.
But, it I worth noting the fact that in accordance with Article 406 of the LCP, as soon as the verdict is announced, the chair of the judicial panel or the sole trial judge shall advice the parties on the right to appeal as well as the right to respond to the appeal.
When a suspended sentence is pronounced, the court has the obligation to warn about the meaning of the suspended sentence and the conditions that the defendant (now convicted) must fulfil.
Was the defendant provided explanation on the terms of appeal?
As shown in the graph above, in 24% of cases, which equals 15 monitored hearings, the court failed to provide explanation on the terms of the appeal even though the court is under such ob-ligation, irrespective of whether the defendant was present at the main hearing with or without a defence attorney.
In 76% of hearings, which equals 48 monitored hearings, the court acted in com-pliance with the law.
One has to underline that these data would not be considered as striking if there were available data that in most of the cases where the court failed to explain the terms of the appeal, the defendant’s attorney was present and could later provide professional advice to his/her client on the appeal procedure, however, no such data were at disposal, and no further comments can be made.
If one summarizes and compares the data on the number of verdicts (convictions) against the data on the number of verdicts based on admission of guilt, one can arrive at the following conclu-sion, as illustrated in the graph below:
The provision on guilty plea is notably applied in in the course of the proceedings in large number of cases.
The data show a high percentage of admission of guilt during the proceedings, i.e. it accounts for 64% of the total number of monitored cases, against 36% of regular (conviction) verdicts.
Generally, this results from the need and the commitment of the defence attorneys to milder sanctions, given that the admission of guilt implies certain percentage to reduce the sentence, and given the attitudes and perceptions that the courts had established for many years concerning the defendants and the unavoidable possible conviction, so that on this ground defendants are more or less convicted, but still convicted.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
Detected problems concerning the improper summoning are still persistent, which further results in failure of the parties, expert witnesses and witnesses to attend court hearings.
Recommendation: It would be necessary that the summoning system for witnesses is further elaborated and improved and an efficient system for electronic service to the parties and experts is introduced, as well as to ensure the active involvement of the Ministry of Interior in providing personal data.
The practice of failing to transfer defendants and detainees from penitentiary institutions poses a problem.
The reasons mainly result from: lack of coordination with the registration system for escorting the transfer of persons deprived of liberty, or lack of financial or transportation means to transfer those persons.
Recommendation: Improved coordination among the respective authorities and improvement of the AKMIS System in order to eliminate the detected problems.
The allocation of budget funds for proper functioning of the courts should be realistic.
In view of the opening statements, there is an established practice of inappropriate formulation and presentation of the respective content; whereby the opening statements are transformed into a plain reading of the indictment, presentation of evidence, putting emphasis on the previous convictions of the defendant, without presentation of the case theory or identification of the legal elements which are to be further debated.
Recommendation: Provision of additional trainings for all participants in the criminal proceed-ings about proper application of the provisions of the LCP that stipulate the opening statements.
The guilty plea as a new instrument is well represented in the national criminal justice system, whereby the application is not dependent on the type of the crime, despite that it is most frequently applied for smaller crimes.
The collected data lead to the conclusion that this instrument is recognised by the parties in the criminal proceedings as an efficient tool for rapid, efficient and effective completion of the criminal proceeding.
Concerning the assessment of the defendant’s guilty plea, it is noted that there is an improper practice by the courts to accept flawed admissions of guilt, that is, situations when the court failed to fully establish whether the defendant made the admission of guilt (guilty plea) knowingly and/or of his/her own will.
Recommendation: Additional training of judges would be necessary in order to ensure proactive protection of justice under conditions when the admission of guilt is made in the course of the main hearing that is, increasing the active role of judges in assessing the admission of guilt.
It was noticed that the courts have adopted an inappropriate practice in their assessment of the admission of guilt that is the courts accept the admission of guilt without it being substantiated by facts.
That is, during the reduced evidentiary hearing, only evidence about previous convictions is presented.
Recommendation: Reform of the Law on Criminal Procedure (LCP) in terms of introducing the authorization for the court to request the parties to present evidence in the proper quantity and quality so that the court can be able to fully accept the defendant’s admission of guilt or introducing provisions on special hearing to determine the type and extent of the sanction.
Rare application of the measures to secure the attendance of the defendant, which can serve as an alternative to the detention, even though the efficiency of such measures has been recognised in other more developed criminal justice systems.
Recommendation:  Introduction  of  adequate  mechanisms  for  application  and  control of milder measures that would enable the court to dispose of sufficient data and guarantees for efficient application of the respective measures.
Such mechanisms may be introduced through changes and amendments to the LCP and the Law on Probation, i.e. to incorporate these measures in the competences of the probation services.
Some inconsistency was noted regarding the legally prescribed order to present evidence, under the explanation that it results from the attempt to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the proceedings.
Recommendation: The provisions of the LCP that stipulate the order in which evidence is presented should be consistently applied.
High percentage of improper application of the provisions of the LCP that stipulate the direct examination, cross-examination and re-cross and re-direct examination of witnesses and expert witnesses was documented, and that this results from inappropriately mastered techniques for examination by the parties to the proceedings.
Recommendation: Additional training of the parties to the criminal proceedings will be required for the purpose of proper application of these provisions.
Unjustified frequent utilization of the court’s authorisation to pose questions once the examination of witnesses/expert witnesses is completed, and an activity of the court which may shift into a special hearing in specific cases.
Recommendation: Reform of the provisions of the LCP in order to ensure that such authorization of the court is eliminated.
Certain  failures  on  the  part  of  the  court  administrative  units  were  noted,  such  as inappropriate announcing of the time and place of court hearings.
Recommendation: Increase the courts’ publicity and transparency by ensuring that the time and place of the court hearings are publicly announced, both on the court’s website and within the court buildings.
Repeatedly noted practice of violating the procedural rights of the defence by restricting the access to evidence or hindering the insight into evidence.
Recommendation: Further improvement of the provisions in the LCP that would eliminate the practice of restricting the access of the defence to the prosecutorial evidence, as well as re-examination of the adopted rules on the costs for insight in the evidence and the transcripts thereof.
An upward trend in the percentage of verdicts which are not publically pronounced and announced.
Recommendation: Consistent application of the provisions from the LCP that stipulate the publicly pronouncing and announcing of verdicts.
OSCE SOUTH EAST EUROPE MEDIA CONFERENCE CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
The OSCE South East Europe Media Conference, held on 10-11 May 2018, gathered over 150 participants in Struga on the shores of Lake Ohrid representing government, civil society, press and media associations, journalist unions, public service media and media professionals to discuss media freedom issues in the region.
The fifth conference followed the Austrian OSCE Chairmanship’s “Media Freedom in the Western Balkans” Conference in February 2017, highlighted participants’ numerous personal and professional experiences with attacks on the safety of journalists, in particular female journalists, and the often precarious working conditions media workers in the region face.
In addition, the conference also delved into issues ranging from Public Service Media, with participants calling for their strengthened independence and financial sustainability, to best practices in the area of media self-regulation, new economic opportunities and challenges, the impact of digitalization on media freedom, and finally the phenomena of “fake news”, propaganda and disinformation.
On the first day of the Conference, participants adopted a declaration condemning the violence against Olivera Lakić, an investigative journalist with the Vijesti newspaper in Montenegro, who was shot the evening of 8 May 2018.
The Declaration sent a strong message of support and solidarity to her, the employees of Vijesti and all journalists and media workers who face threats, attacks and intimidation in the region.
Safety of journalists is still one of the biggest challenges in the region, and many crimes against journalists and media outlets go unpunished.
In the Declaration, participants called for an independent, effective and speedy investigation and for the perpetrators of the attack, including its masterminds, to be brought to justice.
It further emphasized that any attack on a journalist not only violates the rights of the journalist involved, but also undermines the public’s “right to know”, the rule of law and democracy itself.
Following the six sessions on the topics outlined above, the OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media presents the following non-exhaustive findings, conclusions and recommendations from the two-day Conference.
These recommendations have been drafted to apply to multiple stakeholders in the media community and more broadly, including regional policy makers and authorities at every level, academics, media outlets, civil society, the international community working in the region, intermediaries and regulators, journalists’ unions and associations and journalists, themselves.
Participants in the session shared their personal and professional experiences of threats, intimidation, violent attacks, and smear campaigns—both online and offline—that they have faced in their line of work.
Participants also discussed the specific risks faced by female journalists, including intimidation, harassment and threats, given that they encounter the “double burden” of being targeted for both their gender and their profession.
One of the biggest challenges mentioned was a lack of recourse for bringing perpetrators of crimes against journalists to justice, either due to a lack of inadequate legal follow-through or inaction by law enforcement agencies and widespread impunity for such crimes.
The need for adequate legal frameworks to protect journalists’ safety was highlighted, as well as the importance of legal remedies in the event of a crime, and the obligation on the part of authorities to ensure accountability and fight impunity.
In certain parts of the region, though adequate legislation exists, implementation and enforcement are lacking and need to be strengthened.
Condemn publically and unequivocally and in solidarity with victims, all attacks, intimidation and violence against journalists and media workers, which include, but are not limited to: smear campaigns, surveillance, intimidation, forced closure of offices, online harassment, killings, torture, physical violence.
Engage with all relevant stakeholders—namely national authorities, the legislative, executive and judiciary branches of government, local and regional civil society, journalist associations and media outlets—to support investigations and efforts to bring perpetrators to justice, and continue to raise awareness about the threat to democracy posed by attacks against journalists, and the importance of protecting journalists’ safety and security.
Recognize the nexus between media freedom, justice and the rule of law in order to reflect on the specific needs of the media community in relevant legislation, prosecutorial activities and protective mechanisms, including police protection when necessary; this also requires adequate human and financial resources for investigative and prosecutorial processes, and political will.
Continue to call for and enforce swift investigations into attacks against journalists by law enforcement agencies, taking such threats seriously whether they occur on or offline, and provide adequate tools to victims of threats, harassment, violence or intimidation.
this will also require training for and co-operation between police and prosecutors.
Encourage education in newsrooms and in the media sector to train media professionals on self-protection against harassment, intimidation and attacks, including specific digital security training and resources following a threat or attack.
Speak with one voice and foster solidarity at the local, national and regional levels to condemn attacks, i.e. in co-operation with the international community, national authorities, politicians, journalist associations and relevant advocacy groups.
Recognize the double burden faced by female journalists and develop a gender mainstreamed strategy to better ensure their safety online and off.
While participants recognized that authorities have passed legislation in some areas in order to improve the working conditions of journalists and media workers, the media industry continues to face considerable challenges.
Precarious working conditions related to social security, wages and contracts that perpetuate job insecurity prevail.
Paired with political interference and/or business interests, working conditions for journalists and media workers are often at unacceptably low levels.
Due to the precarious working conditions and the economic challenges media outlets face, editorial independence might be undermined by financial and/or political pressure.
Raise awareness of the precarious working conditions for media workers, as manifested by low wages, irregular working hours, lack of health insurance, social security, and other employment benefits.
Awareness should be raised with the clear objective of improving working conditions in order to ensure the ability of journalists and media workers to report independently of political and economic pressure, and without the risk of self-censorship.
Empower, encourage and reform trade unions specifically for media professions and journalists to reinforce collective bargaining, both for fixed-term staff and freelancers working online and off, while fostering a sense of solidarity among those in the profession to increase social and working rights, such as social security, unemployment benefits, and health insurance.
Trade unions need to be recognized as legitimate representatives of journalists.
In the absence of labour unions, liaise with relevant state authorities such as labour inspectorates, to ensure that national social standards (work contracts, working hours, social security payments) are respected, and national minimum standards enforced.
Explore possibilities for collective contracts in the profession as a safety net and assurance of the continued professional security needed for ethical journalism, as in other professions.
Develop and enforce policies and legislation that safeguard media pluralism, maintaining competition without undue business or political interference that might put additional pressure on the editorial line of media and journalists.
Ensure transparency in funding and financial independence of media as key elements to ensure their freedom from outside interference, in particular when funding comes from public bodies.
Authorities should not try to influence the media market through hidden subsidies.
This session focused on the role of the public service media (PSM) and legal frameworks that govern their organizational set-up and programmes.
Participants discussed the role of governing and programmatic councils and their organization.
In particular, best practices that should govern their editorial guidelines, strategic direction and mandate, as well as society’s needs (linguistic, cultural, political) were discussed.
Because content produced by the PSM is primarily in the interest of society and should thus remain in the public domain, reflecting the cultural, ethnic, social, linguistic, religious composition of society and maintaining the interest of the public at all times was identified as important for maintaining credibility and fulfilling the core PSM mandate.
Participants also discussed the need to foster more investigative reporting within the PSM focused on issues affecting society, maintaining professional standards and editorial independence.
Ensure that staffing, including for Programming and Governing Councils, is based on professional merits, not party loyalty, to maintain independence from the political sphere while keeping in mind the public mandate.
Develop individual models for PSM financing according to local realities, given that no single model in the regional context is transposable to the other, and in order to ensure their financial sustainability, contributing to their political independence.
Take into account the cultural, ethnic, social, linguistic, religious composition of society to ensure that the PSM reflect all views represented in society in line with its public interest mandate.
Encourage investigative pieces and journalism also in PSM in line with best practices of the sector.
Foster innovation in the PSM to engage audiences, offering content online and offline that is adapted to society’s needs, including through means of programming and diffusion of information online (including through new technologies such as apps, online content, social media) as well as broadening possible revenue streams.
Representatives from the region, in particular journalists’ associations and interest groups, put forward best practices regarding self-regulation, and professional standards in the media landscape.
The panel concluded that ethical standards adopted on a voluntary basis among associations of journalists or within specific media outlets help media workers produce impartial and objective reporting.
In the region, it is difficult for Press Councils and selfregulatory mechanisms to achieve financial independence and sustainability without donations or public funding, given that media outlets themselves struggle for revenue and are not able to contribute to such Councils.
The panel concluded, however, that proper financial and human resources are needed to maintain editorial independence and journalistic credibility.
Raise awareness on self-regulatory mechanisms as a valuable tool in the region for establishing professional and ethical standards in a diverse media landscape, on a voluntary basis.
Efforts should be made for their consistent implementation.
Support the drafting of self-regulatory codes in a spirit of inclusiveness, transparency and in the interest of the general public, in line with international standards and best practices.
The sustainability of Press Councils should be a priority for the media community given their essential role in facilitating media self-regulation.
Promote training, education, and awareness-raising within the profession to further foster professional standards and independent reporting.
Co-operate with independent investigation mechanisms and self-initiative mechanisms such as Ombudspersons, Press Councils, Independent Commissions, to address issues pertaining ethical and professional journalism.
Digital literacy strategies are important to ensure that journalists and media actors as well as the public are able to effectively engage in media self-regulation.
The focus of this panel was to discuss the impact of digitalization on the media and freedom of expression, and in particular whether it advanced the “democratization” of the media landscape by providing citizens with outlets to express themselves online and journalists with a platform to disseminate their reporting more widely.
Panellists concluded that digitalization also comes with risks, given that media users are now exposed to more information and disinformation.
Digitalization has radically changed print media, even eradicating it in some places.
The session also touched upon the responsibility of news portals which diffuse reports widely, to consider their direct impact on the spread of quality news.
Safeguard, protect and respect basic human rights and rights related to freedom of expression and access to information online just as they are offline.
Focus on quality of news over quantity and speedy delivery in the era of “democratization” of the media through technology.
Given that fact-checking should be the basis of all journalism, continue to strengthen the credibility of media through fact-checking, in particular in the online sphere.
No single model for expanding the revenue base in the digital age has affirmed itself. Media should therefore explore and experiment with different financing models.
Develop training and promote education in the area of digital literacy, as well as awareness-raising on the cost of producing quality journalism.
While the term “fake news” is used frequently, the panel aimed to define, in more concrete terms, what falls under the term and how disinformation seemingly has been more widespread than in the past.
Participants concluded that, while the phenomenon has always existed, it has nevertheless been exacerbated by the use of the Internet, making it easier to spread unverified information and unprofessional reporting.
“Fake news” is not only political, strategically constructed information with a goal to undermine reliable spread of credible information in the public sphere, but also oftentimes driven by business interests.
States should not adopt legal bans on “fake news”, false news or other similar terms that are counterproductive and prone to abuse.
Existing laws, including on civil defamation laws, should provide adequate legal remedies for the dissemination of false information which harm reputation.
Politicians should not make or encourage statements which they know to be false or which demonstrates a reckless disregard for verifiable information.
Politicians should not use the term “fake news” to attack media outlets or journalists, as this undermines trust in media and journalism.
Authorities and other stakeholders should strive to create a free, independent and diverse communication environment in a media-literate society as the best method for countering the spread of false information.
Internet intermediaries must have clear policies for restricting or deleting content which should meet, at a minimum, due process guarantees, and international standards on freedom of expression.
On 30 July, the parliament, without the participation of the main opposition party, issued a decision to hold a consultative referendum on 30 September related to a bilateral agreement with the Republic of Greece, of which a key provision of the agreement calls for changing the constitutional name of the country to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The referendum question to be decided by voters will read, “Are you in favour of EU and NATO membership by accepting the Agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?”
The referendum will be considered valid if a majority of registered voters participate.
The referendum is primarily regulated by the 1991 Constitution, the 2005 Law on Referenda and Citizen Initiatives (Referendum Law), and the 2006 Electoral Code.
The legal framework for the referendum lacks specificity on several key elements of the process, including campaign regulations.
The SEC has introduced specific regulations to clarify the legal framework for this referendum.
The July 2018 amendments to the Electoral Code introduced a temporary State Election Commission (SEC) with a six-month mandate, all members are nominated by political parties.
The SEC has been holding regular public sessions and has published all meeting minutes and most key decisions and information on its website in a timely manner.
Citizens at least 18 years of age have the right to vote, except for those declared legally incapacitated by a court decision.
The voter list was finalized on 7 September and contains 1,806,336 eligible voters, of which 2,694 actively registered for out-of-country voting.
Most ODIHR ROM interlocutors have not raised major concerns about the accuracy of the voter list, despite the importance of reaching the turnout threshold.
The official campaign period began on 30 July, the day of the calling of the referendum.
However, most stakeholders announced that they would begin campaigning on 10 September.
Government officials, foreign leaders and representatives of both EU and NATO have held public speeches on the benefits of integration.
Although there is not currently any active “Against” campaign, 28 civic associations and one political party, not currently represented in the parliament, are advocating for a boycott in order to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50 per cent turnout threshold.
The boycott campaign has been active mostly on social media, often using inflammatory language.
ODIHR ROM interlocutors informed the ROM that the atmosphere in which journalists operate has improved in recent years; however, no structural media reforms have been implemented so far.
The legal framework regulating the conduct of the media during the referendum lacks clarity.
On 3 September the ODIHR ROM commenced qualitative and quantitative media monitoring of 10 television channels.
Following an invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) established a Referendum Observation Mission (ROM) on 27 August to observe the 30 September referendum.
The ODIHR ROM, headed by Ambassador Jan Petersen, consists of a core team of 13 experts based in Skopje and 20 long-term observers deployed throughout the country.
Mission members are drawn from 18 participating States.
Participating States have been requested to provide 250 short-term observers to observe early voting on 29 September and opening, voting, counting and tabulation on 30 September.
Following the parliamentary elections in December 2016, the incumbent Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE), won the largest number of seats but was unable to secure sufficient support to form a government, after the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and other ethnic Albanian parties aligned with the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM).
The president gave the mandate to form the government to the SDSM and DUI only at the end of a period of intense political turmoil.
The new ruling coalition consolidated its position when it won control of the vast majority of municipalities in the 2017 local elections.
The country’s accession to the European Union (EU) and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has historically been blocked as a result of a lack of consensus among member states of these organizations due to a dispute regarding the name of the country.
On 17 June 2018, following a year of intense negotiations, the country signed a bilateral agreement with Greece which, if approved, would change its constitutional name to the “Republic of North Macedonia”.
The decision to hold a consultative referendum on approval of the agreement passed parliament on 30 July, with 68 votes for and none against.
Representatives of the opposition were not present for the vote.
In order for the referendum to be considered valid, a majority of registered voters must participate.
Implementation of the agreement is considered by many to be a precondition for EU and NATO integration, and many ODIHR ROM interlocutors have suggested that the agreement will also impact broader regional political stability.
Representatives of both the EU and NATO, including their leadership, plan to visit the country in the coming weeks to stress the benefits of integration to citizens.
Following the referendum, constitutional amendments would require a two-thirds majority vote in parliament.
Once the amendments are enacted, the agreement would then require adoption by the parliament of Greece.
The referendum is primarily regulated by the 1991 Constitution (last amended in 2011), the 2005 Law on Referenda and Citizen Initiatives (Referendum Law), and the 2006 Electoral Code (last amended in 2018).
Although the Referendum Law sets out the basic rules for the referendum process, it lacks detail on certain substantive issues.
The Referendum Law stipulates that provisions of the Electoral Code apply to the referendum if not otherwise specified.
However, while the Electoral Code provisions on election administration and voter registration will apply, the SEC informed the ODIHR ROM that the campaign rules and campaign finance regulations are not applicable to the referendum.
The SEC has adopted regulations to clarify certain aspects of the legal framework, including the definition and timeline of the referendum campaign, as well as procedures for out-of-country voting, dispute resolution, and voting day procedures.
The Referendum Law requires that the issue being decided be “precisely formulated and unambiguous, so that the citizen may answer ‘for’ or ‘against’”.
The question that will appear on the ballot reads, “Are you in favor of EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Republic of Greece?”
Some ODIHR ROM interlocutors expressed concerns over the compound nature of the question, the focus on both EU and NATO integration, and the lack of explicit reference to the change of the country’s constitutional name.
The referendum will be administered by a three-level administration, comprising the State Election Commission (SEC), 80 Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), the City of Skopje Election Commission, and some 3,480 Election Boards (EBs).
In addition, 33 EBs will be established in Diplomatic–Consular Offices (DCOs) for out-of-country voting, and one in the SEC to administer the voting of EB members deployed to these DCOs.
The July 2018 amendments to the Electoral Code introduced a temporary SEC with a six-month mandate that comprises seven members, three of whom are women.
All members were nominated by parliamentary parties, four from the ruling coalition, including the vice president, and three from the opposition, including the president.
In addition, the Electoral Code foresees the appointment of a deputy secretary general; however, this position has not yet been defined nor filled
The SEC has held regular public meetings as well as additional working meetings that are not open to observers or the public.
The public meetings have been conducted in an efficient and collegial manner.
To date the SEC has adopted a rulebook on the administration of the referendum, has announced official sessions, and adopted minutes of its previous sessions in a timely manner.
The SEC has uploaded most of its decisions and key information on its website.
MECs are composed of five members (and five deputies) who serve a five-year term and are randomly selected from among public employees.
MECs oversee the administration of the referendum in each municipality, appoint and train EBs, and manage other technical preparations.
EBs comprise three members (and three deputies) who are randomly selected from among public employees and are responsible for management of the polling stations and conducting voting and counting procedures.
For the referendum, EBs will not include two temporary members nominated by parties, as provided for in the Electoral Code for ordinary elections.
The SEC is mandated to train members of the lower election management bodies.
Due to a delay in finalizing the content of the training manual, the SEC will not adhere to its original training schedule.
The SEC will train the MECs, which will, in turn, conduct training for the EBs.
The SEC will conduct voter education related to referendum day procedures and how to locate their polling station.
Under the Constitution, citizens at least 18 years of age have the right to vote, except for those declared legally incapacitated by a court decision.
According to the Electoral Code, only persons with a registered address and valid identification card or biometric passport are included in the voter register.
Voter registration is passive for in-country voting.
Voter lists are compiled by the SEC based on data from various civil and population registers.
Public scrutiny of the lists took place from 9 to 23 August, when voters could check their data online and apply to the SEC regional offices with requests for addition, deletion or correction of their personal information.
The SEC closed the voter list on 7 September and the final list includes 1,806,336 eligible voters.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the SEC that 2,694 voters registered for out-of-country voting.
Acting on a prior ODHIR recommendation, the authorities launched an operation to renew expired documents of persons confined in penitentiaries.
This initiative resulted in the issuance of 260 new ID cards.
In addition, the Ministry of Interior has pledged to expedite the renewal processes for all voters with expired documents and will keep their offices open over the weekend of the referendum to allow voters to collect new IDs.
Most ODIHR ROM interlocutors acknowledge outstanding issues related to the accuracy of the voter lists; however, most stakeholders have not raised the accuracy of the voter list as a major concern for the referendum, despite the relevance of the 50 per cent turnout threshold.
The SEC announced that the official campaign period began on 30 July, the day of the announcement of the date for the referendum, but all stakeholders announced that they would begin campaigning on 10 September.
The “For” campaign has so far focused primarily on EU and NATO integration, and has featured a high degree of international involvement, with foreign leaders and representatives of both EU and NATO visiting Skopje to promote the bilateral agreement and encourage turnout.
The parliament, as the official proposer of the referendum, will lead the “For” campaign.
The government has created a website dedicated to the referendum campaign with the message, “Go out for a European Macedonia”, and the prime minister and cabinet members have conducted informational meetings with voters across the country.
In addition, SDSM has joined together with over 100 mostly civil society organizations to advocate for a “For” vote.
Several of the organizations are conducting separate campaigns focusing on specific topics related to their individual mandates.
While VMRO-DPMNE has declared its opposition to the name agreement, describing it as a “capitulation”, the party leaders emphasize their continued support for EU and NATO membership.
The party announced on 11 September that voters should “vote their conscience”.
Although there is so far no active “Against” campaign, 28 civic associations and one political party, not currently represented in the parliament, are advocating for a boycott to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50 per cent turnout threshold.
The boycott campaign has been active mostly on social media and has often featured inflammatory language.
The government has allocated MKD 80 million (approx. EUR 1.3 million) to the parliament to spend on media advertisements during the referendum campaign.
A co-ordination committee headed by the speaker, which includes all deputy speakers and leaders of parliamentary groups, will be responsible for making direct payments to TV stations for airtime.
VMRO-DPMNE criticized this decision and rejected the government funding, stating that it was not in the interest of the citizens to use public financing.
The 71 members who declared they would campaign for the “For” position can submit advertisements or propose individuals to join them in advocating for the referendum using the purchased time.
In addition, parties and other participants may self-finance their campaigns through private donations.
However, the SEC rulebook requires only the parliament as the official proposer to file a campaign finance report, within 30 days of the referendum.
Several stakeholders expressed concerns to the ODIHR ROM about the lack of transparency resulting from the limited regulation of campaign financing.
Some stakeholders raised concerns to the ODIHR ROM about possible pressure on civil servants to vote and abuse of state resources in the government’s campaign.
The media environment consists of numerous broadcasters that function, often with financial difficulties, in a relatively small market.
Some broadcasters informed the ODIHR ROM that the atmosphere in which the media and journalists operate has somewhat improved in recent years, though media remain susceptible to political influence.
The government has drafted amendments to the legal framework governing media which seek to improve the media environment, but no structural reforms have yet been implemented.
Television remains by far the most important source of political information, followed by Internet sources.
The legal framework regulating the conduct of the media during the referendum campaign lacks clarity due to conflicting guidance from the relevant agencies.
The SEC rulebook, issued on 1 August, distinguishes between the ‘authorised proposer’ (parliament) and all other entities, and mandates that special space for the campaign be provided by the media to the parliament.
However, subsequent guidelines adopted by the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services (AVMS) foresee equal access to media for anyone engaged in campaigning for the referendum.
These AVMS guidelines stipulate that radio and television stations may dedicate a total of 9 minutes per hour for advertisements concerning the referendum, in addition to the maximum 12 minutes foreseen for regular commercial ads.
Several TV channels publicly expressed dissatisfaction with the AVMS guidelines and have requested that they be allowed to sell campaign advertisements outside of the allocated 9-minute slots to maximise their commercial opportunities.
The Association of Journalists of Macedonia also raised concern that the payment of political advertisements in the media with public funds will reinforce the influence of political parties on the media and their reporting on political processes.
On 3 September the ODIHR ROM commenced qualitative and quantitative media monitoring of 10 television channels for their coverage of referendum process.
Citizens and authorized representatives of the proposer are allowed to file complaints to the SEC within 24 hours related to irregularities in voting day procedures and tabulation and to appeal SEC decisions within 48 hours to the Supreme Court.
The SEC informed the ODIHR ROM that an electronic system for case and complaint management, as required by the Electoral Code, will be used for the management of referendum complaints.
So far the SEC has not received any complaints.
The SEC handles complaints relating to the composition of electoral bodies and voter registration.
The State Audit Office (SAO) and the State Commission for Preventing Corruption (SCPC) are responsible for complaints related to campaign finance and misuse of administrative resources, respectively.
Decisions of these agencies on these matters may be appealed to the Administrative Court.
Complaints on campaign violations that are considered criminal or civil matters shall be filed with the basic courts.
MECs have no jurisdiction over complaints for the referendum.
Under the Electoral Code, appeals against SEC decisions related to voter registration are heard by the Administrative Court.
However, according to the SEC regulation this competence is shifted to the Supreme Court.
The Electoral Code and the SEC regulations provide for observation of the referendum by international and citizen observers.
Only domestic organizations that were established at least one year prior to the referendum and whose statute includes the principle of human rights protection are allowed to accredit observers.
Under the legal framework, only the “proposer” of the referendum, in this case the parliament, is allowed to appoint one special representative to observe the work of the referendum administration in each commission and polling station.
Two large citizen observer organizations have already started their observation.
MOST has long-term observers present in each municipality, observing the administrative preparations and the campaign.
On referendum day, MOST will have 1,500 observers, including some mobile teams, and will run a Parallel Vote Tabulation exercise with a sample of 33 per cent of the total number of polling stations.
CIVIL-Center for Freedom will observe the referendum with 250 to 300 accredited observers.
The ODIHR ROM commenced its work in Skopje on 27 August.
The Head of Mission met with the President, Prime Minister, Speaker of Parliament, Minister of Foreign Affairs, representatives of political parties, the SEC, the Constitutional Court, media, civil society organizations, the OSCE Mission to Skopje, and the resident international community.
The ROM established contacts with electoral stakeholders at all levels.
The Parliamentary Assembly of Council of Europe (PACE) intends to deploy an observer delegation for referendum day observation.

THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
Assessment of Sharing Personal Information from the Public Registers in the Process of Updating the Voter Register
OSCE/ODIHR Expert Visit
16 – 19 September 2013
Warsaw 12 December 2013
THE FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA
ASSESSMENT OF SHARING PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM THE PUBLIC REGISTERS IN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING THE VOTER REGISTER
INTRODUCTION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
Following an invitation from the State Election Commission (SEC) of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia  to undertake an assessment on the manner in which personal information from citizen’s registers is shared in the process of updating the voter register, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) deployed an Expert Team (the Team) to Skopje from 16 to 19 September 2013.
The OSCE/ODIHR Team included Mr. Zoran Đoković, OSCE/ODIHR Migration/Freedom of Movement Adviser and Mr. Nikolai Vulchanov, external expert.
This expert visit was organized in follow-up to recommendations from past OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Missions (EOMs) and in an effort to assist the authorities and other relevant stakeholders with their implementation.
The visit was in line with the commitment made by all OSCE participating States in the 1999 Charter for European Security, and reaffirmed at the 2002 Ministerial Conference in Porto, to follow up promptly on OSCE/ODIHR election assessments and recommendations.
The Team assessed the process of updating voters’ data included in voter lists based on personal information, including official records of identity, vital life events and place of residence, kept in the civil, residency and other registers maintained by relevant state institutions.
The Team reviewed the applicable regulatory framework and identified areas where improvements could be considered.
With the aim of assessing the quality of information kept in the civil and residency registers and how it reflects on the accuracy of voter lists.
The administrative framework for maintenance of the address register was also analyzed and finally, the Team looked at possible short- and long-term measures to enhance the efficiency of voters’ personal data collection, its updating and sharing by and between state institutions.
The OSCE/ODIHR is grateful to the SEC for the invitation and the opportunity to contribute to its efforts aimed at increasing the accuracy of voter lists, as well as for SEC support in organizing the Team’s visit and the availability of its staff for discussions.
The OSCE/ODIHR wishes to express its appreciation to other institutions and individuals for their openness and availability to provide insight on the topics discussed during the visit (see list of interlocutors in an Annex 1).
The support provided to the Team by the OSCE Mission to Skopje is also highly appreciated.
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Under the Electoral Code of “the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia” (the Electoral Code), the SEC is tasked with maintaining the voter register, from which voter lists are drawn, and with ensuring their accuracy.
To date, the SEC has limited capacity to maintain the voter register and consequently, the voter register is maintained by the State Statistical Office (SSO).
In addition, for the same reason, the SEC does not exercise sufficient quality control over the voter lists.
In updating the voter register, the SEC uses personal identity, vital life events and place of residence information provided by the institutions as defined under the Electoral Code.
It appears that the SEC has yet to develop a sufficiently detailed methodology to assess the voter register for information that could help identify possible discrepancies in the voters’ data or potential abuse of voter registration procedures which require further action.
Under the Electoral Code, the SEC does not have sufficient legal authority to change the information in the voter register submitted by the relevant institutions.
While the SEC’s inspection of the voter register may prompt the SEC to review certain information in the register, amendments are possible only if they are supported by legally valid personal information.
Unless inaccurate information is a result of mistakes in the transfer process, all inaccuracies in the voter register and the voter lists are inherited from information submitted by relevant state institutions legally responsible for registering and maintaining it.
Consequently, it is debatable whether the SEC should be the authority tasked with resolving such inaccuracies.
Voters’ personal data provided by the Ministry of Interior (MoI) are the main source of information used for the compilation of the voter register.
In the process of updating information in the voter register, the MoI provides legally valid information with regard to voters’ identities and places of residence.
The role of the MoI is underscored by the fact that only those citizens in possession of a valid ID issued by the MoI can be included in the voter lists.
Therefore, the accuracy of information provided by the MoI directly affects the accuracy of voter lists.
It would appear that the MoI exercises limited control in ensuring that the information on a registered place of residence is up-to-date.
Some voters may not reside at the places of residence where they are registered as a result of failing to report to the authorities the change of place of residence.
While the mechanism for ensuring that citizens comply with the requirement for reporting the change of place of residence is based on fines, consideration should be given to developing sufficient incentives for citizens to report a change of place of residence in a timely manner to avoid a situation where the registration of residence is maintained even though occupancy rights may have ceased to exist.
Voters that have a long-term residence or live permanently abroad are issued passports and included in the voter lists on the basis of their last known residence address in the country.
The use of the last known address as the criterion for issuing passports to such citizens could be reviewed with a view to protecting their right to vote and to ensure that voter lists are not perceived by the public as inflated.
The Directorate for Keeping Personal Records (the Directorate) under the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) is responsible for the registration of legally valid personal information on identity and vital life events of citizens.
However, in the process of updating information in the voter register, the role of the Directorate is limited to providing information on deceased voters which is communicated to the SEC through regular updates from the MoI and directly via SEC’s regional offices.
While sharing of population and voter information between institutions overall works, it does so using different levels of technology including paper flow or the copying of a large array of data on compact disks, rather than having direct on-line access to the data maintained by other institutions.
In the short term, the SEC should develop a detailed set of queries to assess the accuracy of the voter register and to provide regular updates to the public on the changes made in the register.
Such activities could serve to further enhance public confidence in the voter lists.
The SEC should also run an inspection of the voter register to detect information which would require further follow-up by the authorities responsible for its maintenance and updating.
This is particularly important with regard to information concerning the number of changes of place of residence in a given municipality or if unusually high numbers of people are registered as residing at the same address.
In the long term, it could be useful to assess the cost-effectiveness of maintaining a voter register in parallel to the registers of citizens maintained by the MoI or in the future by the Directorate under the MoJ.
In this context, consideration could be given as to whether either of these two agencies which are legally responsible for the registration of personal information should also be responsible for the compilation of the voter lists on the basis of information they already have, and whether political consensus for such a decision could be reached.
Alternatively, it might be necessary to fully develop the capacity of the SEC to assume responsibility for the maintenance of the voter register.
BACKGROUND
The quality of voter lists has been a long-standing issue.
It has been commented upon in OSCE/ODIHR election observation reports and joint opinions of the OSCE/ODIHR and the Council of Europe’s Commission for Democracy Through Law (the Venice Commission).
These documents underscored the need to review and audit voter lists with a view to increase their accuracy and enhance public confidence in the voter registration process.
For the 2011 early parliamentary elections, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM Final Report highlighted that 1.82 million citizens, out of an estimated population of 2.05 million, were eligible to vote.
The report further underlined that a difference between the number of registered voters and the estimated size of population led to “[…] persistent doubts about the accuracy of the voter lists […]’ and recommended a “[…] thorough audit and revision of the voter lists […] to focus on entries of deceased people and citizens residing abroad […]”.
Following the 2011 parliamentary elections and on the basis of broad political agreement, the authorities introduced an interpretation of Article 41(4) of the Electoral Code4, whereby after 29 February 2012 the term “valid documents” would mean the issuance of a new personal identity card or travel document (international passport) with biometric features.
To address recommendations from the OSCE/ODIHR EOM Final Report on the 2011 early parliamentary elections, in 2012, the government established a Working Group on Voter Lists tasked to review the voter lists and define policy actions aimed at increasing the accuracy of voter lists.
The Working Group concentrated on monitoring the progress of the issuance of new identification documents and biometric passports since the possession of these documents determined voting right eligibility.
For the municipal elections held in March 2013, 1,743,403 voters were determined eligible to vote and included in the voter lists.
Compared with the 2011 early parliamentary elections, some 119,000 people were removed from the voter lists as they did not possess a personal identity card or biometric passport.
In its final report for these elections, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM reported that complaints regarding the accuracy of voter lists persisted while also taking note of enhanced public confidence in the accuracy of voter lists.
The OSCE/ODIHR recommended that “[…] Consideration should be given to conducting a review of the procedures for compiling and maintaining voter lists. Clear, coordinated, and transparent procedures would enhance accuracy of the voter lists and contribute to public confidence. […].”.
Based on Article 42 of the Electoral Code, registration of vital life events defining personal identity, such as birth, death and marriage or divorce, as well as the registration of permanent residence, is key to the compilation of accurate voter lists.
Therefore, the Team focused on these procedures, with a view to assessing them in the context of the collection, updating and sharing of citizens’ personal data related to vital life events and permanent residence between institutions.
ASSESSMENT FINDINGS
MAINTENANCE OF THE VOTER REGISTER
Voter registration is regulated in Articles 2, 5-6, 31 and 41 – 56. of the Electoral Code.
The right to vote is granted to citizens who are 18 years old, reside in the constituency, or municipality, where the election takes place and have a valid personal identity card or passport.
Citizens exercise their voting right at a polling station located within the area defined by the SEC and within which they have registered a place of residence.
The Electoral Code does not specify a requirement that a voter should reside for a specific period of time ahead of Election Day within a given constituency in order to have the right to vote.
In line with Article 41(2) of the Electoral Code, the SEC is responsible to maintain the voter register from which voter lists are to be extracted.
However, since the authority over voter registration was transferred from the MoJ to the SEC in 2009, the SEC still does not have appropriate resources to manage the voter register and to produce voter lists without external support.
In accordance with Article 203 of the Electoral Code, until the SEC is technically ready to maintain a voter register without external support, it is maintained by the SSO.
The Team was informed that with appropriate investment to expand the SEC’s technical capacity, the SEC feels confident that it could maintain the voter register.
At the same time, the Team was informed of an ongoing project implemented by the SEC aimed at computerizing its regional offices and providing them with online connection with the SEC.
It appears however, that concrete projects and feasibility studies aimed at building the SEC’s internal capacity to maintain voter register have not been yet developed.
While the SSO processes the information related to the voter register and extracts the voter lists, the SEC oversees the voter registration process and coordinates the activities on obtaining information from other institutions tasked with providing information to update the voter register.
In terms of providing data for the update of the voter register, the SEC provides to the SSO three types of information: the first type of data relates to the information on the delineation of polling station areas defining which streets and addresses each polling station is comprised of.
The second type of data relates to the information on deceased voters collected by the SEC’s regional offices.
The third type of data relates to information on changes of personal information in the voter register requested by voters via direct application to the SEC’s regional offices.
For the 2013 municipal elections the SEC, for the first time, printed the voter lists for each polling station were provided by the SSO.
The Electoral Code defines which legally valid personal information is used for updating the voter register and the authorities responsible for providing this information.
With regard to the volume of information that each institution provides to the SSO to update the voter register, the MoI emerges as the most important provider of legally valid information.
The data provided by the MoI is based on the register of issued personal identity cards and travel documents (with biometric features) which contains all information relevant for the identity of voters (name, surname, name of one parent), vital life events (date of birth, information of deceased voters) and the place of residence (address).
Finally, the information provided by the MoI on issued personal identity cards and travel documents including on their validity directly determines who can be added to the voter lists.
The MoI is responsible for submitting    the above mentioned information to the SEC twice a year on a regular basis and on the day following the day of the calling of the election.
Apart from the information received from the MoI, the SSO also receives information on deceased voters on a permanent basis.
The information is collected by the SEC via its regional branches on the basis of the information on deceased voters submitted to the SEC regional branches by the regional registrar offices operating under the Directorate at the MoJ.
The SEC regional offices also forward the information on the persons who submitted requests to update their information in the voter register after presenting a valid identification document.
It is noteworthy that under the existing SSO procedures for processing information in the voter register, whenever information received through regular MoI updates (information on deceased voters or other personal information) is different from existing information in the register, even if information has been received through regular updates from the SEC regional offices, the newly received information from the MoI prevails.
Information on streets in the databases of the MoI and the SSO are codified meaning that each physical address is represented as a unique code.
Based on the street codes in their databases reference can be made to the existing and previous names of the street.
Central to ensuring that both institutions operate with the most recent and valid information related to street names is the information provided by the Central Register responsible for verifying legally valid street names and their corresponding codes.
REGISTERS USED FOR UPDATING THE VOTER REGISTER
a) Registration of vital life events
Registration of vital life events such as birth, death, marriage, including other relevant identity information (name, surname, parents’ names) is one of the basic sovereign prerogatives of states through which states register legally valid information pertaining to a person’s identity and on the basis of which the state recognizes the identity of physical persons including their relationships with other persons.
The registration of vital life events and relevant identity information is regulated by the Law on Personal Records which defines the Directorate under the MoJ responsible for registering, storing and updating this information.
Generally, the fundamental principle implemented by the law is that vital life events are registered in the respective register kept at the location where the event occurred, with exceptions detailed by the law.
Vital life events are recorded, in two original paper copies.
The 32 regional branches of the Directorate report on the registration to the central office on a regular basis and each of the 173 local offices report to the regional office twice per week.
Most of the registers maintained by the Directorate are paper based.
The Team was informed that the Directorate is in the process of procuring equipment which should allow for the electronic maintenance of the registers.
To that end, the Directorate is undertaking a digitalization of existing paper records where some 20 per cent of approximately nine million paper based records collected and updated since 1900 have already been entered into the electronic database.
Once complete, the database will include all information from the existing books of birth, death and marriage.
The intention of the Directorate is to complete this project by July 2015.
The Directorate does not intend to scan and to include original acts establishing the occurrence of vital life events in the database; instead, the data from the records will be transferred to the electronic database using manual data entry.
The Directorate also plans to cross check the information stored in the new database with the information on citizens stored in the database of the MoI.
The Directorate’s regional branches provide a copy of the death certificate ex-officio to: (i) the birth register at the place of birth, (ii) the marriage register at the place of the marriage, (iii) the respective regional office of the MoI and (iv) the respective regional office of the SEC at the location of the registered permanent residence.
Finally, the information is also communicated to the SSO for statistical purposes.
Although the Directorate is responsible for the registration of personal information pertaining to the identity of citizens, it does not provide this information directly to the SEC for the purpose of updating the voter register.
Instead, this information is provided by the MoI which collects information on a person’s identity in the process of issuing identification documents and biometric passports.
As part of the document issuance process, the MoI copies relevant information on a person’s identity from birth and marriage certificates issued by the Directorate.
The fact that the information on a voter’s identity is obtained through an intermediate institution (MoI) and not from the institution legally responsible for its registration (the Directorate) could lead to discrepancies in relation to the updated identity information and the identity information as reported by the MoI.
This possibility exists since the MoI will reflect the change of information on a person’s identity only when this information is reported by the person in a certified format when requesting a new personal identity card or travel document.
Such a data discrepancy is most likely to occur in cases when a person changes name or surname.
Discrepancies in data related to other vital life events such as birth and death appear unlikely as the Directorate’s regional branches communicate this information to the MoI ex-officio.
As the Directorate’s regional branches communicate registered deaths ex-officio, this information reaches the SEC through three independent channels of communication.
First, the Directorate communicates this information via the SEC regional offices.
Second, the same information is also communicated to the MoI which provides this information to the SEC at the first scheduled update of the voter register.
Third, the information is communicated directly to the SSO for statistical processing.
Consequently the information directly communicated to the SEC has value in terms of updating the voter register only in the period after the last update from the MoI was received and until the voter lists are finalized immediately before elections.
Every time the MoI submits information for updating of the voter register it already contains all information on deceased voters which was previously communicated to the SEC.
The Team was informed that the SSO conducts detailed inspections on all data inconsistencies (i.e. deaths reported by the SEC regional offices but not reported by the MoI).
It would appear that communication of registered deaths sent directly to the SSO is not used for the purpose of updating the voter register.
b) Registration of residence and issuance of a personal identity card and a travel documents with biometric features
In the context of voter registration, residence information is used to determine, on the basis of registered permanent residence, the polling station where the voting right can be exercised.
For local elections, voters’ residence addresses also determine the municipality in which a person may stand as a candidate and the municipality for which she/he has the right to vote.
Further to the registered place of residence, a possession of a valid personal identity card or travel document determines the eligibility to vote.
The MoI is responsible for keeping and updating the records for registration and de-registration of permanent and/or temporary residence of citizens, the records on issued unique personal identity numbers and the records on issued personal identity cards and travel documents.
With this comprehensive set of registers, the MoI is in possession of all personal information relevant for the identity, vital life events and place of residence of each citizen including the information on personal identity cards and passports issued to citizens including their validity.
It is noteworthy that in terms of legal authority to register personal information, the MoI is responsible only for the registration of place of residence, the unique personal identity number and the issuance of personal identity cards and travel documents.
Registration of legally valid identity information and information on vital life events is the responsibility of the MoJ which maintains separate registers where this information is stored.
In the process of registration of place of residence or the issuance of identity cards and/or travel documents, the information pertaining to one’s identity is copied by the MoI from documentary evidence on the identity (such are birth and citizenship certificates) issued by the Directorate at the MoJ.
Residence registration and documents issuance for citizens residing within the country
The registration and deregistration of permanent and/or temporary residence of citizens is regulated by the Law on Registration of Permanent and Temporary Residence of Citizens.
Article 2 of the law provides that: “Permanent residence shall be a place where the citizen has settled with the intention to permanently live there and where (s)he has ensured him/herself an accommodation.”.
Citizens who have the intention to permanently reside in the state including those temporarily residing abroad are obliged under the law to register permanent residence and to report a change of permanent residence.
When changing permanent residence persons are required to de-register from the ‘old’ permanent residence and register the ‘new’ residence within eight days.
Within a further 15 days, the MoI should adopt a decision related to the reported change of permanent residence.
Failure by the MoI to adopt a (positive or negative) decision with regard to the reported request for a change of residence, leads to the submitter having the    right to invoke a lengthy appeal administrative procedure.
Children’s permanent residence is registered, at birth and with any subsequent change of residence of their parents.
Failure to register residence in accordance with the legal framework is sanctioned by a fine in the range of EUR 100 and EUR 500, in line with Article 16 of the Law on Registration of Permanent and Temporary Residence of Citizens.
To complete residency registration, citizens have to submit documentary evidence proving the right to reside at a given property.
There are several issues that affect the accuracy of registered information in relation to the place of permanent residence.
As the registration of a place of residence, as well as the change of a place of residence, is made upon a citizen’s request, the accuracy of permanent residence information depends on timely reporting by citizens about where they actually reside.
However, once citizens complete registration of place of residence, it appears that the MoI exercises limited control in determining if over time they continue to reside at the registered place of residence and if the legal grounds on the basis of which residency was registered have ceased to exist.
The law envisages that a person failing to report an accurate place of residence will be sanctioned.
However, the MoI has no mechanism to establish if the person no longer meets the requirement to maintain his or her registered residence at a reported location.
While the law envisages a detailed procedure for appealing a decision of the MoI on the registration of a place of residence, such a procedure can be invoked only by the applicant.
At the same time, new owner(s) cannot invoke the procedure for terminating the registration of a place of residence, if they have acquired a property where a person maintains a registered place of residence or property owner(s) have terminated a lease contract with a person with a registered residence at the property.
Registration of permanent residence is closely linked with the issuance of personal identity cards and travel documents since if the person changes residence he or she also should change the identity document.
Registration of a change of place of residence for the owners of personal identity cards and travel documents means that these would also have to be changed as the residence address is printed on both documents.
Considering that obtaining new identity documents could be a lengthy process, citizens may decide to delay their reporting on a change of residence.
Registration of and documents issuance to citizens residing abroad
Citizens who reside abroad and who apply for a new travel document or to replace it must inter alia provide information on their permanent residence in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia11 despite the fact, that a citizen may have no intention to live at the declared permanent residence.
While the address of a citizen’s permanent residence would generally indicate a link between the individual and a location in-country where he or she would exercise his or her legal rights and deliver his or her responsibilities, the situation for citizens living abroad may be different.
This is particularly valid for the diaspora and their successors who are generally permanent residents abroad and quite often might also be citizens of the country where they reside.
In accordance with Article 12 of the Guidelines on the Manner of Issuance of Passports and Collective Passports for the Citizens of the Republic Of Macedonia and the Procedure for Issuance of Visas for those Passports, citizens who for any reasons remain residing abroad and who do not want to or cannot register residence on the territory of the state, shall submit the request for issuance of travel document to the Ministry of Interior according to the place of their last residence”.
However in practice, this provision may result in persons registered at a place of residence (address) where they are no longer entitled to reside.
For instance, property at the address of a lastly registered residence may no longer even exist or may have changed the owner.
Over time the issue is compounded by the fact that descendants of the person residing aboard would also have their residence registered at the last residence of their parents.
Citizens who live abroad and have a permanent residence in the state are included in the voter lists according to their last registered permanent residence and are marked on the lists by an asterisk.
Citizens who move abroad and intend to live there for more than three months should report their intention either to MoI regional offices, border check points or consular offices abroad.
In all cases, reports are submitted to the MoI.
Representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed the Team that they encounter difficulties with establishing deaths of citizens abroad especially for those citizens who permanently resettled abroad and who have no property in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
c) Address register
Permanent and temporary residence is registered at a specific address, including the name of the municipality and the town or village, the name of the street and the house number.
There is a database for the administrative division of the country maintained by the Central Register, which provides for a unique digital code for each street in towns and villages where there is an established system of streets.
There is no unique digital code for house numbers, although it would appear that the Central Register is currently developing this feature; however the unique digital code for house numbers does not include the unique street code.
The change of street names is under the authority of municipal councils.
A change of a street name affects the validity of personal identity documents and may have consequences for the processing of voter lists.
The Team was informed of isolated cases whereby street names on voters’ IDs differed from those printed on the voter lists.
There appeared to be a solution in place which provided that both the ‘old’ street name (as provided for on the personal identity document) and the ‘new’ street name were included in the voter lists.
Since the new documents have been introduced relatively recently, the difference between official street names and the street names printed on identity cards/passports appears limited to date, but with time one could expect that the discrepancy of official street names vis à vis those printed on identity cards/travel documents is likely to increase.
d) Sharing of Information between State Institutions
The Team was under the impression that while sharing of population and voter information between institutions is taking place, it does so using different levels of technology including paper flow or copying a large array of data on compact disks, rather than having direct access to data of other institutions.
The unique personal identification number is used as the sole criteria for matching personal records from different databases in the process of updating personal information in the voter register and to ensure integrity of personal information in the databases.
The unique personal identification number is also used as a unique identifier in updating information received in paper format.
Collection of biometric data stored in the MoI database ensures that each person has only one personal record to which a unique identification number is assigned and it safeguards against the creation of several records with its corresponding unique personal identification number which belongs to the same person.
A government project on the interoperability of data between electronic databases maintained by the authorities is underway.
Its main goal is to eliminate possibilities for duplication of activities of different institutions in data registration and to ensure direct access to up-to-date data by different institutions.
It is not clear when this project will yield practical results with regard to the registration of citizens and voters.
Both the MoI and the Ministry of Information Society and Administration in charge of the data interoperability project indicated that the information technology platform used by the MoI, the institution in charge of the largest amount of population and voter registration related data, was outdated and that in order to increase data interoperability the information technology of the MoI should be upgraded.
The SSO and the SEC are considered for inclusion in the data interoperability project during its second phase.
e) Authority for changing information in the voter lists
The SEC has the authority to oversee the accuracy of information in the voter register.
Article 42 (1) of the Electoral Code provides that SEC has the official duty to record, add and delete data in the Voters List, based on data from the books for registration of vital life events, registries of residence and citizenship, other official records, and through direct inspection.
This provision determines that the SEC makes amendments to the voter lists on the basis of    official records and it also gives the authority to the SEC to make amendments through direct inspection.
What direct inspection entails is not entirely clear.
The SEC appears to be operating on the premise that the recording and inclusion of additions to and deletions in the voter lists should only be done on the basis of legally valid information from civil and residency registration books.
While some SEC members acknowledged the responsibility of the SEC to amend the voter register through direct inspection, it seems that no procedures for such an inspection exist.
The Team was informed however, that often in the process of updating voter registration, and in instances where there is a discrepancy in information received from different institutions, the correct information is determined through direct inspection.
It is unlikely that the SEC can be granted the authority to amend any data in the register through direct inspection, such as door-to-door visits, without ensuring that data is legally valid.
However, a precise legal clarification on this specific provision is lacking.
The Team came to the conclusion that the SEC conducts a limited inspection of the voter lists and that not all options have been tried to exercise queries into the voter register database which could highlight potential issues with voter registration such as an unusual number of newly registered residences in certain areas in the run-up to elections or an unusually high number of residents registered at a specific address.
In the situation where the voter register is solely based on legally valid records in the civil and residence register, the information in the voter register will be as accurate as the information in the civil and residence registers.
Therefore the accuracy of voter lists is directly linked to the accuracy of civil and residence registers where the inspection of voter lists represents de facto inspection of the work done by the institutions which have provided the data.
In such circumstances, the SEC could go as far as highlighting possible issues related to the data it had received for the update of the voter register, but at the same time it cannot be held accountable for inaccurate information in the voter lists as long as it fully corresponds with data received by the relevant institutions.
ENHANCING COLLECTION AND SHARING OF THE INFORMATION IN THE FUTURE
Overall, the legal framework includes all pieces of legislation necessary to maintain an accurate record of vital life events, residence, personal identity cards and travel documents.
The authorities might consider updating sublegal acts in order to further improve the registration of permanent residence for citizens.
Requirements for the issuance of travel documents for the citizens permanently residing abroad could benefit from further review.
Possible improvements could be considered in the short-to-medium and the longer term.
Activities in the short term should aim at immediate efforts to restore public confidence, while in the long term, decisions should be made based on a broad political agreement to establish a transparent system of registration that will be implemented systematically and enjoys public trust and respect.
POSSIBLE SHORT TERM ACTIVITIES
As a confidence building measure for the public with a view to enhancing the transparency of voter registration, the SEC could design a set of queries to analyze the voter register as it stands after the 2013 municipal elections.
The analysis could be based on a set of queries searching the voter register for possible groups of multiple records.
The queries could be run on a regular basis by the SSO on behalf of the SEC.
The starting point in designing such a set could be Annex 2 (Possible Queries to Identify Potential Groups of Multiple Records) of this Report, which should not be considered as an exhaustive example.
In addition, the SEC could also design an information sheet to provide, on a regular basis, statistical information for each municipality on the numbers of newly issued personal identity cards and travel documents, new registrations and de-registrations of permanent residence, and other facts relevant to the compilation of accurate voter lists.
Consideration could also be given to regulate, by an internal SEC regulation that such queries are run on a regular basis and made public.
During the period of public scrutiny of the voter lists, the queries could be run and the results be made public on a daily basis.
Bearing in mind that such an analysis would imply inspecting the work of other institutions which are providing data in the voter registration process, consideration should be given to phasing out the requirement that the SEC inspects and is held accountable for data accuracy and to transfer this responsibility to those institutions which are responsible for providing data for updating the voter lists.
Consideration should also be given to reviewing the existing body of legal and sub-legal acts relevant to the registration of vital life events, citizenship, and permanent residence with a view to updating outdated regulations, and assessing possibilities for further harmonization of the legal framework, by taking into account the current technologies for maintaining the respective registers.
In addition, this review could also confirm that there is no duplication of efforts in transferring the information form the relevant institutions to the SEC.
Legal and practical arrangements should be made to ensure that citizens comply with the requirement to report a change of residence.
To this end consideration should be given to promoting incentives for reporting a change of residence and not to rely exclusively on sanctions.
To ensure that a registered place of residence is correct, property owners should be provided with a mechanism to challenge the registration of a place of residence at their property if a person no longer lives at their property or if the property lease contract has expired.
In terms of communicating information on deceased voters, consideration should be given to conveying this information by the Directorate directly to the SSO considering that such a channel of communication already exists.
Since the Directorate transmits this information to the MoI as well, to streamline the process of communicating information on deceased voters the regional branches of the Directorate should inform on deceased voters directly to the SSO   only in the period after elections were called, starting from the most recent voter register update received by the MoI until the cut-off date for the closing of the voter lists.
Consideration should be given to establishing specific arrangements to inform all institutions involved in the compilation of voter lists in a timely manner, ex officio, about changing names as a result of marriage or divorce, so that voter lists include both the ‘old’ and the ‘new’ name.
A change of residence implies a change of personal identity documents which may deter people to report a change of residence; as a result such persons will be on the voter lists in locations where they do not de facto live.
Personal identity cards or travel documents should be used to only establish people’s identities and the address should not necessarily be viewed as identity data.
Consideration could be given to removing the requirement that voters who live permanently abroad and exercise their rights and responsibilities where they live declare an address of permanent residence within the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
They should rather only declare the location of family origin as a proof for the link to their country of origin.
POSSIBLE ACTIVITIES IN THE LONG TERM
In the long term the Electoral Code postulates that the SEC should build its internal capacity to process the voter register to maintain voter list information.
To that end, the SEC should work on developing technical terms of reference for the implementation of such a system which should include appropriate human resources and define annual running costs before moving forward with the implementation.
The implementation of such a system could be assessed in terms of cost effectiveness of running a voter register parallel to other registers of citizens and in particular compared to the existing register maintained by the MoI or a future civil register that is yet to be established by the Directorate.
To ensure an accurate allocation of voters to their nearest polling station, consideration should be given to upgrading the database for streets and addresses maintained by the Central Register and to transform it into an address register by introducing unique digital codes at the level of house, entrance and apartment numbers.
This approach would further enhance the establishment of a unique link between the identity of a person and its geographic location.
As a consequence, the residence register would be built on the civil register which includes the identity data of all resident citizens and on the address register which would include all existing addresses.
Consideration could be given to prioritizing the inclusion of the SSO and the SEC in the data interoperability project, which currently plays an important role in the compilation of the voter lists.
It could also be considered in the future to assess the cost-effectiveness of maintaining a voter register in parallel to the registers of citizens maintained by the MoI or by the Directorate under the MoJ.
In this context, consideration could be given as to whether either of these two agencies legally responsible for the registration of personal information should also be responsible for the compilation of voter lists on the basis of information they already have, and whether political consensus for such a decision could be reached.
Such an assessment should take into account ongoing improvements in the management of personal information through the project on the establishment of electronic civil register, the creation of the technical conditions for the interoperability of digital information stored in the databases of relevant institutions, and the fact that the SEC does not have the authority to change personal information in the voter register which contradicts legally valid information.
Alternatively, it would be necessary to fully develop the capacity of the SEC to assume responsibility for the maintenance of the voter register.
ABOUT THE OSCE/ODIHR
The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) is the OSCE’s principal institution to assist participating States “to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, to abide by the rule of law, to promote principles of democracy and (…) to build, strengthen and protect democratic institutions, as well as promote tolerance throughout society” (1992 Helsinki Summit Document).
This is referred to as the OSCE human dimension.
The OSCE/ODIHR, based in Warsaw (Poland) was created as the Office for Free Elections at the 1990 Paris Summit and started operating in May 1991.
One year later, the name of the Office was changed to reflect an expanded mandate to include human rights and democratization.
Today it employs over 130 staff.
The OSCE/ODIHR is the lead agency in Europe in the field of election observation.
Every year, it co-ordinates and organizes the deployment of thousands of observers to assess whether elections in the OSCE region are conducted in line with OSCE Commitments, other international standards for democratic elections and national legislation.
Its unique methodology provides an in-depth insight into the electoral process in its entirety.
Through assistance projects, the OSCE/ODIHR helps participating States to improve their electoral framework.
The Office’s democratization activities include: rule of law, legislative support, democratic governance, migration and freedom of movement, and gender equality.
The OSCE/ODIHR implements a number of targeted assistance programs annually, seeking to develop democratic structures.
The OSCE/ODIHR also assists participating States’ in fulfilling their obligations to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms consistent with OSCE human dimension commitments.
This is achieved by working with a variety of partners to foster collaboration, build capacity and provide expertise in thematic areas including human rights in the fight against terrorism, enhancing the human rights protection of trafficked persons, human rights education and training, human rights monitoring and reporting, and women’s human rights and security.
Within the field of tolerance and non-discrimination, the OSCE/ODIHR provides support to the participating States in strengthening their response to hate crimes and incidents of racism, xenophobia, anti-Semitism and other forms of intolerance.
The OSCE/ODIHR's activities related to tolerance and non-discrimination are focused on the following areas: legislation; law enforcement training; monitoring, reporting on, and following up on responses to hate-motivated crimes and incidents; as well as educational activities to promote tolerance, respect, and mutual understanding.
The OSCE/ODIHR provides advice to participating States on their policies on Roma and Sinti.
It promotes capacity-building and networking among Roma and Sinti communities, and encourages the participation of Roma and Sinti representatives in policy-making bodies.
All ODIHR activities are carried out in close co-ordination and co-operation with OSCE participating States, OSCE institutions and field operations, as well as with other international organizations.

2011 Early Parliamentary Elections
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
INTERIM REPORT No. 1
6 May – 15 May
20 May 2011
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Parliament voted to dissolve itself on 15 April 2011 and early parliamentary elections were called for 5 June.
A total of 123 Members of Parliament (MPs) will be elected including, for the first time, one MP from each of the three newly established out-of-country districts.
These are the first elections to be conducted since the Electoral Code was significantly amended in April 2011.
The amendments address several recommendations previously offered by OSCE/ODIHR, however, a number of concerns remain unaddressed.
Sixteen political parties and two coalitions will compete in these elections.
Candidate lists from one party and from one group of voters were denied registration by the State Election Commission (SEC).
The pre-campaign period has been tense and marked by strident rhetoric with the two coalitions accusing each other of voter intimidation.
The official 20-day election campaign begins on 16 May.
Several parties have already started to actively promote themselves through newspaper advertisements, billboards and distribution of campaign material.
The SEC announced that they would consider the issue of early campaigning only if they receive complaints from electoral contestants.
At the time of reporting, no complaints had been submitted.
The final number of registered voters is 1,821,122, including 7,258 registered for out-of-country voting.
The voter lists were posted for public scrutiny between 25 April and 4 May and 18,662 voters checked their records at local offices, through an internet-based search programme, and by emailing a dedicated office at the SEC.
The elections are administered by a three-tiered election administration, including the SEC, 84 Municipal Election Commissions and 2,976 Election Boards (EBs).
For the first time, an additional 36 EBs will be located in diplomatic and consular offices abroad to facilitate out-of-country voting.
The SEC sessions are open to observers, the media, and the public.
Those observed by the OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission (EOM) were highly politicized.
Discussion and voting were strictly along party lines, particularly when the media were present.
In the absence of the media the SEC deliberations were more relaxed and consensual.
A large number of media outlets exist in the country and television is the main source for political information.
The Broadcasting Council has adopted rulebooks that regulate the coverage of the campaign period and, for the first time, the pre-campaign period.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM commenced its activities in Skopje on 6 May, with a 12-member core team.
On 9 May, 20 long-term observers were deployed throughout the country.
II. INTRODUCTION
Parliament voted to dissolve itself on 15 April 2011 and early parliamentary elections were called for 5 June.
In anticipation of an official invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA), the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) sent a Needs Assessment Mission (NAM) to Skopje from 5 to 7 April.
Based on the recommendation of the OSCE/ODIHR NAM, and following the receipt of an invitation from the MFA an Election Observation Mission (EOM) was established on 6 May.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM, headed by Mr. Julian Peel Yates, consists of a 12-member core team based in Skopje and 20 long-term observers deployed in 10 locations throughout the country.
OSCE/ODIHR has requested participating States to second 300 short-term observers to follow election day procedures.
OSCE/ODIHR has previously observed 11 elections in the country.
III. POLITICAL CONTEXT
The 5 June elections will be the second consecutive early parliamentary elections.
They were called after a protracted boycott of parliament by the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) and several other opposition parties.
The boycott started on 28 January in response to the freezing of bank accounts of four media outlets as a part of a criminal investigation linked to the owner of A1 Television.
In the last parliamentary elections, held on 1 June 2008, 63 mandates were won by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPNME)-led coalition, 27 by the Sun coalition led by SDSM, 18 by the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI), 11 by the Democratic Party of the Albanians (DPA) and 1 by the Party for European Future (PEI).
A government coalition was subsequently formed by the VMRO-DPMNE coalition, with DUI and PEI.
IV. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ELECTION SYSYTEM
The Electoral Code is the primary law which regulates parliamentary elections.
It was amended in April 2011 by a slim majority, with opposition parties boycotting the vote.
As most electoral deadlines have been shortened by five days for early elections, questions have been raised whether the necessary preparations and information outreach to electoral stakeholders can be implemented within this timeframe.
The revised Electoral Code addresses several recommendations previously offered by OSCE/ODIHR.
However, a number of concerns remain unaddressed, including: a short timeframe for the courts and election administration bodies to hear and decide on complaints; a prohibition on submitting complaints by post; a lack of clarity on the resumption of candidacy rights for those who have served the penalty for a committed crime; and a revised ceiling on donations from corporations for campaign funding.
A total of 123 Members of Parliament (MPs) will be elected to serve four-year terms.
120 MPs will be elected under a proportional representation system from six electoral districts, and, for the first time, one MP will be elected under a majoritarian system from each of the three new out-of-country districts of Europe and Africa, North and South America, and Australia and Asia.
The transparency of campaign finance has been enhanced by a requirement for parties to submit interim reports on their campaign expenditures to the State Election Commission (SEC), State Audit Office and the State Commission for Prevention of Corruption.
The reports are then required to be published on the websites of these institutions.
However, no deadlines are envisaged for verifying reports submitted prior to election day.
V. ELECTION ADMINISTRATION
The Electoral Code foresees a three-tiered election administration including the SEC, 84 Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), 2,976 in-country Election Boards (EBs), and up to 50 out-of-country EBs located in diplomatic and consular offices abroad.
The SEC is a permanent body appointed for a four-year mandate by parliament.
It consists of seven members and oversees the general preparations for elections.
The SEC President and two members are nominated by the parliamentary opposition parties while the Vice President and three members are nominated by the governing parties.
The current SEC was appointed in 2008, however, the President resigned on 23 February 2011 and parliament elected a successor on 12 April.
The SEC sessions are open to international and domestic observers from civil society, and the media.
The SEC sessions observed thus far have been highly politicized.
Discussions and voting were strictly along party lines, particularly when the media were present.
In the absence of the media, the SEC deliberations were more relaxed and consensual.
MECs are responsible for overseeing the election process in each municipality.
MECs are professional bodies of five members, and are randomly selected from civil servants and public service employees.
All MEC members were newly appointed on 26 April to serve a five-year mandate.
EBs are responsible for particular polling stations prior to and on election day.
EBs are composed using a mixed professional-political model, with one member nominated by the governing political parties, one by the opposition parties, and three members randomly selected from public service employees.
All lower-level election bodies followed the principle of “adequate and equitable” representation of ethnic groups and gender.
However, the SEC has only one woman member.
The SEC has instituted a compulsory training program for the lower-level election commissions which began on 4 May and included the EBs for the out-of-country polling stations.
VI. VOTER LISTS
The responsibility for updating and maintaining the voter lists lies with the SEC.
The public inspection of extracts of the voter lists took place between 25 April and 4 May.
The extracts were available for inspection at the SEC regional and local offices through an internet-based search programme, and by emailing a dedicated office at the SEC.
According to information published on the SEC website 18,662 people checked their data during this period out of whom 42 people were newly registered, 756 deceased were deleted ex officio,8 6 deceased were deleted at the request of citizens, 210 changes to personal data were requested by citizens, and 24 persons applied to be registered but were rejected.
The SEC announced on 15 May that the final voter lists for the 2011 parliamentary elections contain 1,821,122 voters, some 29,000 more than the 2009 presidential and municipal elections.
A total of 7,258 people registered for out-of-country voting.
4,653 in electoral district seven which covers Europe and Africa, 1,832 in electoral district eight which covers North and South America and 773 in electoral district nine which covers Australia and Asia.
VII. CONTESTANTS AND CAMPAIGN ENVIRONMENT
Parliamentary elections may be contested by candidates nominated by political parties, coalitions of political parties, or by independent candidates nominated by groups of voters.
Two large coalitions, one led by SDSM and one by VMRO-DPMNE,10 as well as sixteen political parties submitted candidate lists to the SEC by the 5 May deadline and will compete in these elections.
Candidate lists from one party and one group of citizens were denied registration by the SEC.
Even though the official campaign period does not start until 16 May, the political climate has been somewhat fractious and strident rhetoric has been used, particularly by the VMRO-DPMNE and SDSM led coalitions, which accused each other of unlawful behaviour in an attempt to influence voters’ freedom of choice.
There have been widespread allegations of threats of loss of employment made against civil servants if they do not secure a certain number of votes for the ruling coalition.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM has received documents from several sources concerning these allegations.
Both parties have publicized documents containing lists of names of people allegedly pressured to vote for the opponent.
VMRO-DPMNE has announced that it will file lawsuits against A1 Television for broadcasting a news item about alleged intimidation, as well as against SDSM for allegedly bribing voters.
The atmosphere appears to be calmer in the ethnic Albanian political arena.
The two traditional rivals, DUI and DPA signed an Electoral Pact on 4 May committing to a democratic election process, to refrain from hate speech, insults and provocations, and to recognize the election results.
Two new ethnic Albanian political parties, New Democracy (ND) and the National Democratic Renewal (NDR), are running for the first time.
On 12 May all political parties signed a Code of Conduct.
The signatories committed themselves to promote democratic elections, a climate of tolerance, and to publicly condemn violence and intimidation.
Several parties have already started actively promoting themselves before the official start of the campaign.
Instances of early campaigning include paid double-page advertisements in several newspapers, links on newspapers’ websites to campaign videos posted on the internet, and the distribution of campaign material.
Billboards have also appeared in Skopje, some declaring “Are You for Victory” with a circled yes12 and others supporting specific political parties.
The SEC announced that they would consider the issue of early campaigning only if they receive complaints from electoral contestants.
So far, the SEC has received no complaints in this regard.
VIII. THE MEDIA
A large number of media outlets exist in the country, including 14 national, 12 satellite and 130 regional TV and radio stations as well as 10 daily newspapers.
Television remains the main source for political information, while national broadcasters dominate the advertising market.
The coverage of the election campaign is regulated by the Electoral Code and the Law on Broadcasting Activity.
In addition, the Broadcasting Council (BC) adopted one rulebook regulating the coverage of the campaign period and, for the first time, one rulebook regulating the pre-campaign period.
The BC oversees compliance of the broadcast media with the legislation and rulebooks.
Since 15 April the body has been monitoring 16 national broadcast media outlets.
With the official start of the campaign on 16 May the BC intends to monitor 154 broadcast media outlets.
During the reporting period the BC initiated misdemeanour procedures against Kanal 5 and A1 Television for not supplying all necessary information when publishing the results of public opinion polls, and against TV Alb for airing paid political advertisements before the official start of the campaign period.
In addition, notifications were sent to four media outlets (MTV 1, Kanal 5, A1 Television, and Radio Metropolis) stating that the publication of advertisements paid by state institutions are prohibited after the announcement of the elections.
Article 76(a) of the Electoral Code requires the Public Broadcaster, Macedonian Radio and Television (MRT), to allocate free airtime to all candidates.
On 10 May, MRT decided to allocate to each electoral contestant three minutes per electoral district in which the party/coalition is running.
The law does not stipulate the time during which the free time should be allocated.
MRT decided to allocate time between 16.00 and 16.30, clearly outside of prime time viewing.
In addition, MRT is planning to organize 14 90-minute debates between electoral contestants.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM’s media monitoring is conducted in two time periods: the first from 9 May to 15 May, covering the period before the official campaign begins.
The second will cover the official campaign period from 16 May to 3 June.
The media monitoring consists of quantitative and qualitative analysis of the prime time broadcasts of two public and five private TV channels, as well as five daily newspapers.
IX. COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
The Electoral Code provides for various legal avenues for protecting electoral rights, including appeals on voter registration issues, appeals against denial of registration, complaints concerning campaign offences and election results.
All of these fall under the jurisdiction of different appeal bodies.
The SEC is the competent body to deal with complaints from candidates and voters regarding election procedures.
SEC decisions can be appealed to the Administrative Court.
Complaints on campaign irregularities must be submitted to Basic Courts, whose decisions can be appealed to the Court of Appeals.
Criminal complaints are also filed in the Basic Courts and can be appealed to the Court of Appeals.
A further appeal can be taken to the Supreme Court, as the last instance.
The State Prosecutor is mandated to launch a criminal investigation whenever he is notified of an electoral offence.
At the time of reporting, no formal complaints have been lodged regarding voter lists or candidate registration.
On 11 May, the State Prosecutor launched an investigation into an alleged case of voter intimidation by VMRO-DPMNE, as reported in the media.
The State Prosecutor informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that the case would be handled as an urgent procedure and be resolved before election day.
X. OSCE/ODIHR EOM ACTIVITIES
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM commenced its activities in Skopje on 6 May, with a 12-member core team.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM has so far met the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, the Minister of Internal Affairs, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the leaders of all main political parties, media, domestic observer groups, the Acting Head of the OSCE Mission to Skopje, and ambassadors of OSCE participating States.
A first briefing for the diplomatic community will be held on 16 May.
The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe will deploy observer delegations for election-day observation.
The OSCE Chairperson-in-Office has appointed Mr. Roberto Battelli, OSCE PA Treasurer and Special Representative on South East Europe, as Special Co-ordinator to lead the OSCE short-term observer mission for these elections.
