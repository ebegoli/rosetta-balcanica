It planned to outsource voter education services but due to procurement problems, this did not take place.
The SEC therefore just modified a programme, originally designed for the 2016 parliamentary elections.
Radio, TV, print and social media were used to disseminate the message that, while informative and useful, was assessed by OSCE/ODIHR EOM as barely noticeable.
Voter education spots increased in the last week ahead of the runoffs, but the SEC’s overall outreach efforts were minimal.
Sign language was not added to the campaign spots and voter education materials for persons with visual impairments or mental and intellectual disabilities were not produced.
Positively, the SEC, in co-operation with civil society, mapped polling stations that were accessible for wheelchairs and placed this information online.
In addition, in several municipalities civil society made efforts to foster greater inclusion of persons with disabilities and vulnerable communities in the election process.
In Kumanovo, a civic initiative was launched to assist persons with disabilities to exercise their voting rights; and in Prilep a CSO raised awareness on suffrage rights in the Roma community.
In order to enhance the effective exercise of voting rights, the SEC should develop and implement a comprehensive  and  nationwide  civic  and  voter  education  programme,  including  for  voters  with various types of disabilities.
VOTER REGISTRATION
All  citizens  who  reached  the  age  of  18  have  the  right  to  vote,  except  those  declared  legally incapacitated  by  a  court  decision.
Such  a  restriction  is  at  odds  with  OSCE  commitments  and international obligations.
Furthermore, only persons with a registered address in the respective municipality and a valid identification card or a biometric passport are included in the voter register.
This effectively disenfranchised eligible voters whose identification documents (IDs) had expired or were to expire before the election day and who were not able to renew them before the list was finalized.
Such limitations contradict the constitutional provision for universal suffrage and are at odds with paragraph 7.3 of the 1990 OSCE Copenhagen Document.
As previously recommended, the EC should be revised to include all eligible voters in the voter lists, regardless of the validity of their identification documents.
In line with international obligations, limitations on voting rights on the basis of legal incapacity should be removed, whilst necessary support mechanisms to exercise the right to vote should be provided.
In addition, the law does not have a provision for voters in hospitals, long-term care facilities and retirement homes, hence these voters were not able to vote.
The EC contains a general provision for homebound voting, while the SEC regulation details eligibility criteria.
A cumbersome application procedure, however, unduly hindered the opportunity for eligible voters to cast their ballot, at odds with international standards.
In several cases the SEC, breaching its own regulation, overturned MEC decisions and approved homebound voting for persons not falling under the categories listed in the regulation.
The law should provide an opportunity for all persons entitled to vote including persons in healthcare institutions, long-term care facilities and retirement homes to exercise their right.
Consideration should  also  be  given  to  revising  the  regulation  for  homebound  voting  eligibility  to  enhance participation.
Voter registration is passive.
The SEC maintains the voter register based on data extracted from civil and population registers.
Four times a year, it updates the register based on data provided by various state agencies.
The day after an election is called, a supplementary update of the voter register is conducted.
The SEC has the right to undertake random inspections for accuracy.
For these elections, the SEC did not deem it necessary to undertake a comprehensive verification of the voter register.
Public scrutiny of voter lists took place from 21 August until 9 September.
During this period, more than 220,000 voters checked their data online and in-person, but only 230 requested corrections.
On 16 September, two days after the deadline, parties, but not independent candidates, received a copy of the voter list.
Parties requested only a few changes.
As a result, many interlocutors acknowledged growing confidence in the integrity of the voter register, while some continued to express concern.
A total of 1,814,644 voters were registered for these elections.
The SEC approved final voter lists on 25 September, a day after the official deadline.
Printed lists were sent to the MECs, which then delivered them to the EBs.
There are no provisions for updating lists between rounds, effectively disenfranchising voters whose IDs expired and who turned 18 years old between the rounds, at odds with OSCE commitments and international standards on suffrage rights.
In addition 900 prisoners were unable to vote because they could not renew their IDs.
To improve the accuracy of the voter list and to facilitate voters’ participation, an update of the voter lists between the rounds should be considered.
Consideration should be given to extending the period of scrutiny of the voter lists and to bringing the deadline for changes closer to election day.
On 25 October, the SEC adopted a decision by which voters who were on the list, but whose IDs expired as of 9 September were not allowed to vote.
The SEC called on voters to renew IDs before the second round.
CANDIDATE REGISTRATION
Any  eligible  voter  residing  in  the  respective  municipality  may  stand  for  election,  except  those currently in prison or waiting to serve a prison term of more than six months.
Candidates may be nominated by parties, coalitions of parties, or, for independent candidates, by groups of voters.
The latter are required to support a nomination with signatures from 100 to 1,000 voters depending on the number of voters in the municipality, which is equivalent to 0.2 to 4.8 per cent of eligible voters residing in the respective municipality.
This impinges on the equality of citizens’ ability to stand for election and goes against good practice, which recommends that supporting signatures should not exceed  one  per  cent  of  registered  voters.
Positively,  as  previously  recommended  by  the OSCE/ODIHR, voters may now sign in support of more than one candidate.
However, signatures are still to be collected in the presence of an SEC representative.
In small communities, such requirements may have a dissuasive or intimidating effect on some voters.
Consideration could be given to standardising the required number of signatures for independent candidates at up to one per cent of registered voters in line with international good practice.
In addition, as previously recommended, consideration could be given to providing alternative methods for signature collection in order to reduce the potential for intimidation.
Following a largely inclusive registration process, 19 parties and coalitions and 65 groups of voters fielded a total of 6,630 candidates on 370 lists for the council elections, and 258 mayoral candidates, including 19 independents, for the mayoral elections.
Candidate registration ended on 19 September and lists were published on SEC website on 25 September, as well as displayed at MEC offices for familiarization.
As MECs decide on registration, no data was available nationally on the number and reasons for rejected lists or candidates.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM is aware of the rejection of five candidate lists, which was appealed to and dismissed by the Administrative Court in all of these cases.
However, approved lists and candidates are not subject to legal challenge.
A legal challenge was made by a party against a coalition that ran with the same name and logo as the party.
The complaint was rejected as it is not prohibited for a coalition or a list submitted by a group of voters to use the same name and/or logo as a registered party.
There is no provision for withdrawal of candidates.
The EC could be revised to prohibit coalitions and lists, submitted by a group of voters, from using the same name/or logo as a registered party and to regulate the withdrawal of candidates.
Contrary to the EC, the SEC held two lotteries on candidate order on the ballot; one for parties and coalitions, and the other for groups of voters.
It discriminated against independent candidates, as they were placed at the bottom of the ballots.
To enhance gender equality, the EC requires candidate lists to include at least 40 per cent of the less represented gender.
Also, at least one candidate of each gender must be placed within every three spots  on  the  list,  and  additionally  within  every  ten.
On  17  September,  after  the  deadline  for nominations and in a response to requests by political parties, the SEC amended a regulation detailing how the gender quota should be applied.
It contradicted the EC and undermined the gender quota.
MECs registered 9 lists with fewer than 40 per cent female candidates.
11 lists did not have a woman in every third place and 6 did not have one in every tenth spot.
MECs attributed this to oversight and arithmetical errors.
Notably, however, one MEC that received a list with too few male candidates requested it to be corrected.
Fourteen per cent of all lists were led by a woman, while of all mayoral candidates, a mere six per cent were women.
Six female mayoral candidates progressed to the second round.
Political parties should comply with the gender quota requirements set out in the EC; while the SEC and MECs should strictly enforce the legislation.
Approval of the lists should be subject to judicial review.
CAMPAIGN ENVIRONMENT
For the first round, the official campaign commenced on 25 September and ended at midnight on 13 October; for the second round, it lasted from 16 October until midnight on 27 October.
Campaigning prior to the official period, including holding meetings with voters to promote campaign platforms, is banned and subject to a high fine.
While official campaign periods can be established for providing special rights such as free media access and free space for campaign posters, as noted in previous OSCE/ODIHR reports, generally restricting campaign activity is contrary to international standards and constitutional guarantees of freedom of expression and assembly.
The EC comprehensively regulates campaigning and generally provides for a level playing field, although  independent  candidates  are  not  granted  full  equitable  conditions,  such  as  designated billboard space and media coverage.
The law aims to protect voters from undue pressure, prevent vote-buying, uphold a separation of the state and party during elections, as well as ban the misuse of administrative resources, including prohibitions against state and local governments making payments that are not already budgeted for, initiating new public infrastructure projects, and terminating or filling public positions.
The EC should guarantee independent candidates campaign conditions on an equitable basis with other contestants.
Prior to the official campaign period, on 5 September the government adopted a Declaration on Free and Fair Elections, calling on public and state officials to refrain from fraudulent activities and to respect voters’ right to choose freely.
On 24 September at the SEC and MECs, most mayoral candidates signed a code of conduct pledging to uphold the law.
The pre-campaign environment was generally calm with a few isolated incidents, including some vandalised campaign offices.
There were some instances of contestants campaigning in the silence period.
Several complaints were made to law enforcement and the election administration on this matter.
The campaign took place in an environment where fundamental freedoms of assembly and expression were generally respected.
Voters were offered a range of choices and highly-contested races took place  in  many  municipalities.
Campaigns  commenced  with  festive  rallies,  where  party  leaders presented their candidates, unveiled slogans, and outlined policy platforms.
Electoral contestants tended to focus on their party support base,  conducted door-to-door canvassing  and small-scale meetings.
Large billboards appeared in urban centres, predominantly featuring mayoral candidates.
Some parties opened temporary campaign offices where centrally produced campaign goods were distributed.
Using social media was an indispensable campaign tool.
Many candidates opened official Facebook accounts, where they predominantly posted pictures from rallies and meetings rather than discussed policy  issues  or  interacted  with  voters.
Overall,  candidates  from  larger  parties,  particularly  the VMRO-DPMNE, used social media more frequently compared to other parties and independent candidates.
Contestants also purchased advertisements in broadcast, print and online media.
Strategies for municipal campaigns were drawn up at the central level and implemented locally.
Prior to the first round, some party leaders, while holding rallies in administrative centres, campaigned on national issues of stability and integration and linked them to local issues of water, sanitation and infrastructure.
The VMRO-DPMNE, and to a lesser extent, the SDSM, used negative messages and tone during rallies.
Regardless of this, OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors consistently noted an improvement in the campaign environment and conduct.
Smaller parties and independent candidates ran modest campaigns where they presented their visions for local development.
A number of them complained to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM about the lack of a level playing field and noted that they had difficulties to fund their campaigns, pay campaign staff, and organize larger-scale campaign events in comparison to larger and better funded parties.
The generally peaceful atmosphere exhibited during the first round continued during the second round.
Before the second round the AA announced a new coalition with BESA, while the SDSM reaffirmed its support for DUI.
Campaign strategies were redesigned centrally, and candidates were given more autonomy locally.
Overall the campaign for the second round was subdued, becoming dynamic only a few days before elections.
Candidates focused on direct communication and face to face interaction with voters.
Only a few large-scale rallies took place and candidates reduced their presence  on  social  media.
Some  contestants  focused  on  communities  where  the  turnout  was particularly low during the first round.
With a number of tight races in ethnic Albanian areas, the campaign  rhetoric  became  more  intense  and  occasionally  aggressive,  as  compared  to  the municipalities with the SDSM versus VMRO-DPMNE runoffs.
Positively, in Arachinovo the SDSM supported  a  female  Albanian  candidate  from  DUI,  who  was  elected.
OSCE/ODIHR  EOM interlocutors noted that the second round was more competitive, with parties vying for support outside their traditional bases.
A strict separation of state administration from campaign activities was not always adhered to.
On 19 September, using an urgent procedure, the government adopted several laws providing financial and social benefits to citizens.
During the election period, there was also a parliamentary debate on a controversial draft law on languages that includes the official status for the Albanian language.
Prior to the second round, the Prime Minister, at times in his official capacity, addressed the electorate at SDSM rallies, and regularly used his official Twitter account to send campaign messages.
He promoted inclusivity, local development and EU and NATO integration.
Some parties expressed concerns about the Prime Minister pledging government support for municipalities that elect an SDSM or DUI mayor.
These actions undermined the separation of the state and party, which is provided for by the OSCE commitments.
As previously recommended, authorities should exercise greater political will to ensure sufficient separation between state and party.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM was informed by interlocutors about misuse of administrative resources in several municipalities and is aware of some complaints on this matter that were filed with the relevant authorities.
Some  concerned  initiation  of  road  construction  and  other  infrastructure  projects  in contravention of the EC.
A number of cases related to terminations, transfers or hiring of public employees, in violation of the EC, were brought to the attention of the OSCE/ODIHR EOM.
Other instances included a municipality advertising jobs for a private company and misuse of position by two incumbent mayors.
In addition, charges were laid against two mayors for abuse of office, including one case involving direct use of administrative resources for the campaign.
Throughout the campaign, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM noted many allegations of pressure on voters, intimidation and vote-buying by different parties; some of these allegations were credible.
The OSCE/ODIHR  EOM  was  informed  by  various  stakeholders  about  such  instances  in  at  least  10 different municipalities, with pressure on vulnerable groups and threats of repercussions against public employees being the most frequent allegations.
However, only a few official complaints were filed  with  respective  law  enforcement  authorities  on  these  matters.
Any  actions  that  create  an atmosphere in which voters feel that they are not able to freely cast their votes without fear of retribution are contrary to OSCE commitments.
In addition, one civil society organization (CSO) received  many  complaints  of  minors  being  used  in  the  campaigns  of  almost  all  parties,  which signalled significant concerns with regard to this issue.
All instances and allegations of pressure, intimidation, vote-buying and misuse of administrative resources should be thoroughly and effectively investigated and prosecuted by authorities in a timely manner.
There should also be civic education aimed at alleviation of corrupt activities in election campaigns with input from respective agencies.
A few isolated politically-motivated incidents occurred across the country, related to attacks on campaign offices and violence against one candidate.
Prior to the first round, in Shuto Orizari the incumbent mayoral candidate for the Union of Roma from Macedonia (URM) was attacked and injured.
Between the rounds, animosity between the candidates’ supporters continued, resulting in a high police presence.
Incidents in Shuto Orizari exposed tensions and a high degree of polarization in the Roma community.
The promotion of women’s participation in public life did not prominently feature in campaigns.
During rallies, female candidates were often on the main stage, but rarely spoke.
However, women candidates who met with the OSCE/ODIHR EOM did not express concern on the lack of equal opportunity to campaign.
On average 23 per cent of attendees at rallies observed were women; a lower women’s  participation  rate  was  noted  at  rallies  in  ethnic  Albanian  areas.
Within  campaign management teams, women did not hold prominent leadership positions.
It is recommended that political parties and relevant institutions take initiatives to encourage the participation of women in the electoral process and in political decision-making.
CAMPAIGN FINANCE
Campaign finance regulations have undergone significant development in recent years, in line with previous recommendations of the OSCE/ODIHR, Venice Commission, and Council of Europe’s Group of States against Corruption (GRECO).
However, some previous recommendations and limitations in the legal framework remain unaddressed, reducing transparency and accountability.
In addition, concerns have been raised by the European Commission about a lack of political will to create an effective mechanism for monitoring the financing of campaigns, and overlapping mandates of various institutions and law enforcement agencies.
Campaigns  are  funded  by  party  membership  fees  and  private  donations.
Public,  foreign  and anonymous donations, among other sources, are prohibited.
Donations are limited to EUR 3,000 for individuals  and  EUR  30,000  for  legal  entities,  including  in-kind  contributions.
The  campaign spending limit is EUR 1.8 per registered voter in a municipality, for each round.
All campaign transactions are to be administered through a dedicated bank account.
Campaign expenses are reimbursed by the local administration at a rate of EUR 0.24 per vote received for lists that obtain at least 1.5 per cent of all votes cast in a municipality.
Breach of most campaign finance rules results in partial or full cancellation of the reimbursement and/or the application of strict fines, and in some cases prison terms.
Two interim reports were to be submitted to the SEC, State Audit Office (SAO) and SCPC by contestants prior to the first round (on 5 and 14 October) and one in the second round (on 28 October).
A large number of contestants failed to submit the interim reports by the deadline or at all resulting in limited access to campaign finance data for voters prior to casting ballots; many were sent by post for arrival after election day, including by VMRO-DPMNE in both rounds.
Despite a previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendation, there are no fines for failure to submit interim reports on time, limiting enforceability.
While interim reports are to be published by the relevant institutions and contestants, no deadline for this is provided; only the SEC promptly published most reports.
The Ministry of Finance issued a new reporting template that requires comprehensive information about all donors and donations and, in line with a previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendation, a detailed breakdown  of  expenditures  thus  improving  transparency.
However,  the  interim  reports  of  some parties, including the SDSM, did not break down advertising expenses in the detail required by the template.
In addition, according to the SDSM, its reports reflected only about half of its expenditures as many invoices had not been received, particularly for TV advertising.
Moreover, some parties spent in excess of reported income, reportedly using bank credit to fund the excess expenses, in contravention of the law.
Some reports, especially those of groups of voters, used the outdated less detailed template.
Larger political parties spent most of their campaign funds on paid advertising in traditional and online media; thirteen reports list zero income and expenditures.
The EC should require interim campaign finance reports be submitted electronically and establish suitable penalties for late or non-submission.
The template should include a breakdown of expenses by municipality and require reporting of incurred expenses.
In addition, the law should require the publishing of interim and final reports on the day of submission.
The SAO is responsible for campaign finance oversight, including handling complaints and referring violations to the relevant law enforcement bodies.
However, interim finance reports are not subject to any review, preventing early detection of irregularities.
The SAO is required to audit the final reports, to be submitted within four months of the election, an unduly protracted deadline.
Contrary to good practice, the EC does not define the scope of audits and the SAO does not have investigative powers.
According to the SAO, it only verifies income and expenses, not aiming at detecting violations.
Furthermore, not all reports are audited, due to its limited mandate and resources.
This does not fulfil transparency and accountability requirements as outlined in international standards and good practice.
The SAO did not receive any complaints or referred any matters to law enforcement bodies.
The SAO should be mandated to conduct a review of interim reports, and to publish its findings and refer possible violations to appropriate authorities prior to election day.
The deadline for filing final reports should be within 30 days after the election.
The law should establish the scope of audits to ensure comprehensive review against any possible infringement, and SAO granted the necessary investigatory powers.
Established penalties for all violations should be imposed.
MEDIA
Media Environment
The media landscape, characterized by a large number of operators in a small market, includes around 170 media outlets.
Television is the main source of information, the circulation of newspapers is low, while growing Internet penetration has led to a significant development of online news websites.
The Albanian language media market exists alongside the Macedonian one.
Overall, the media is divided along political lines and concerns still persist on low professional standards in a number of media outlets to the detriment of the public’s right to receive objective and balanced reporting.
The  public  broadcaster  Macedonian  Radio  and  Television  (MRT)  operates  MTV1,  MTV2,  a Parliamentary Channel as well as three radio stations.
Public broadcaster MTV2 (Albanian language channel) and private TV station Alsat-M, are the two major nationwide Albanian language media outlets.
The private broadcasters TV Sitel, Kanal 5 and Telma are the most watched channels in the country.
On  19  September  2017,  the  parliament  abolished  the  broadcasting  fee  that  financed  the  public broadcaster,  the  Agency  for  Audio  and  Audiovisual  Media  Services  (AVMS)  and  Macedonian Broadcasting (MRD).
From 1 October 2017, these institutions are funded only from the state budget.
OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors noted concerns that such funding limits may hinder the AVMS and further weaken the MRT as a public broadcaster due to possible political interference.
Legal Framework
The Constitution guarantees freedom of expression and prohibits censorship.
The EC requires all media, including news websites, to cover the elections in a fair, balanced and unbiased manner.
However, the EC does not explicitly provide for equitable media coverage for independent candidates.
The paid advertising in private media is strictly regulated as is MRT news coverage of elections.
In addition,  the  MRT  is  required  to  provide  political  contestants  with  free  airtime  for  political presentation within primetime hours.
Prior to both rounds, the allocation of free airtime slots was determined according to the date of the candidates’ requests, contrary to EC provisions.
Media compliance with the legal requirements is monitored by the AVMS, which refers potential violations and complaints to the relevant court.
The AVMS conducted systematic media monitoring and regularly published reports on its website.
The AVMS initiated 14 misdemeanour proceedings against nine media outlets on violations pertaining to paid political advertising, unbalanced reporting, the publication of opinion polls and violation of campaign silence.
The basic courts issued decisions in four cases, in three imposing fines lower than prescribed by the EC and in one case issuing an official  warning.
Two  decisions  were  appealed  by  the  AVMS  on  grounds  that  the  fines  were insufficient.
The AVMS has proved its professionalism during the elections, entirely fulfilling its mandate.
However, the effectiveness of adjudicating media-related complaints was undermined by courts missing legal deadlines and imposing fines below those prescribed in the law.
Furthermore, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors expressed concerns about the appointment of the AVMS Council.
On September 2017, new amendments to the Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services have been proposed in order to change the election procedure of the AVMS Council and to ensure the independence from political interference.
To further safeguard the role of the AVMS, its members should be appointed in a manner that ensures its independence from political influence.
The OSCE/ODIHR Media Monitoring Findings
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM media monitoring results showed that, as required by the EC, the MRT provided all contestants with free-of-charge airtime within prime time.
However, only 26 candidates used this opportunity on MTV1 during the first round and 5 candidates during the second round.
In neither round did any Albanian speaking candidates request free airtime on MTV2.
Regrettably, overall the MRT lacked in-depth reporting, limiting the analytical information available to voters, and provided scant coverage to women candidates and politicians.
The  MRT  should  strengthen  its  role  as  public  broadcaster  by  improving  the  quality  of  the programmes.
It  should  promote  pluralism,  provide  a  broader  range  of  political  viewpoints, professionalise journalism, disseminate voter education programmes and increase women’s political participation by providing them with greater news coverage.
The MRT news coverage, while in line with the EC, disadvantaged smaller parties and independent candidates.
In the first round, on MTV1, the SDSM received 37 per cent of coverage, the VMRO-DPMNE 32 per cent, the DUI 11 per cent and BESA 7 per cent.
Other parliamentary parties were devoted a combined total of 9 per cent of coverage, while parties without seats in the parliament received 3 per cent and independent candidates 1 per cent.
MTV2 dedicated more time to the ethnic Albanian parties.
In the run-up to the second round, monitored media mainly focused on the outcomes of the first round with limited reporting on second round campaigning.
News coverage devoted to the contestants increased only in the final week of the campaign.
The public broadcaster devoted, among others, 25 per cent of news coverage to the SDSM, 24 per cent to the VMRO-DPMNE, 20 per cent to the DUI, 15 per cent to BESA and 9 per cent to AA.
The legal requirement for the MRT to provide an exact amount of time in every newscast devoted to the coverage of parties’ campaign activities should be replaced with a more general requirement to allow equitable access and news coverage of smaller parties and independent candidates, as well as preserving the balance between the principle of equal opportunities among contestants, pluralism of views and journalistic freedom.
During the first round, private media provided coverage predominantly to the SDSM, mainly through paid advertising.
The SDSM received 47 per cent of the total coverage, followed by the VMRO-DPMNE with 29 per cent and DUI with 17 per cent.
The SDSM aired negative advertisements throughout the first round campaign.
During the second round, private channels devoted 40 per cent of news coverage to the SDSM, 35 per cent to the VMRO-DPMNE, 9 per cent to DUI, 9 per cent to AA, 4 per cent to BESA and 2 per cent to DPA.
A high number of paid advertising spots, negative in tone, were used by the VMRO-DPMNE, and at times by the SDSM, as in the first round.
Both  public  and  private  broadcast  media  conducted  debates  among  mayoral  candidates  in  their respective  municipalities  and  in  the  MRT  studio  in  Skopje.
The  debates  were  well  organized; however, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM media monitoring showed that a high number of invited VMRO-DPMNE candidates did not participate during the first round.
During the runoff, there were fewer debates; eight debates between the SDSM and VMRO-DPMNE candidates were hosted by the public MTV1 and the private Kanal
No debate with ethnic Albanian and independent candidates took place before the runoffs.
Voter education spots produced by the SEC and iVote were frequently aired by all monitored media especially in the week before election day.
In the second round, voter education spots were shorter and aired less frequently compared to the first round.
The Albanian language channel MTV2 did not broadcast any voter education as according to the broadcaster the SEC did not provide any spots.
In both rounds, the monitored newspapers generally provided most coverage to the two main parties, the SDSM and the VMRO-DPMNE, and were neutral in tone, except the newspaper Sloboden Pecat, which showed a very critical coverage, including in tone, towards the VMRO-DPMNE party leader and candidates.
The campaign silence period in both rounds was respected by all monitored media outlets with the exception of the newspaper Sloboden Pecat.
On 29 October, a journalist and a cameraman from the private broadcaster TV 21-M were threatened and prevented from performing their duties.
On 2 November, during a court case in Skopje Basic Court 1, a cameraman from TV 21-M and photo reporter from an online news outlet of Kosovo, were detained by the police for more than six hours without being given the opportunity to inform the editorial office or their families.
The Association of Journalists of Macedonia submitted a complaint to the MoI, strongly condemning the police action and asking for a full investigation.
COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
The EC establishes a centralized election complaints process, with the SEC adjudicating cases in the first instance.
The MECs do not handle complaints, placing an unnecessary burden on the highest election body to consider potentially numerous complaints in a short timeframe.
In addition, the SEC’s legal department, established in 2014 in line with an earlier OSCE/ODIHR recommendation, was  underutilized  and  did  not  function  effectively  partly  due  to  the  politicization  of  the commission.
SEC decisions on complaints and annulments can be appealed to the Administrative Court, which is the final instance in almost all cases, while the basic courts have jurisdiction over election-related civil and criminal cases.
Deadlines for submission and adjudication of complaints and appeals are unduly short, preventing the right to seek effective legal redress.
Consideration  could  be  given  to  the  decentralization  of the  complaints  process,  and  the  MECs capacity to handle complaints could be strengthened.
The SEC’s functioning on legal matters could be  enhanced  through  more  effective  use  of  its  legal  department.
Deadlines  for  submission  and adjudication of complaints should be in line with international good practice.
The judicial system is not structurally independent and various interlocutors lacked trust in the ability of the courts, law enforcement bodies, and the election administration to impartially and effectively handle election-related cases.
Some opined that there was no point in initiating cases through those formal channels.
In addition, five Administrative Court judges, who are under pending indictment for the misuse of office in handling a key complaint in the 2013 municipal elections, continued to adjudicate cases in these elections, contributing to the perception of bias.
The EC provides only a limited framework for effective legal redress in electoral disputes.
While certain decisions of the SEC and MECs are subject to judicial review, most are not, thus significant aspects of the electoral process are under the final authority of the election administration.
This contravenes the constitutional guarantee and OSCE commitments.
In addition, stakeholders have only  limited  rights  to  seek  a  legal  remedy  for  campaign-related  violations.
Contrary  to  good practice, voters can only challenge decisions that strictly affect their personal right to vote; citizen observers do not have a right to file a complaint, and only contestants can challenge the results.
All decisions and (in)actions of the MECs and SEC should be subject to timely and effective judicial redress.
Voters and citizen observers should be entitled to file any type of election-related complaint, including against the results.
Prior to the first round election day, the SEC received few complaints under its limited jurisdiction.
It adjudicated  on  the  merits  of  one  case  against  a  MEC  decision  that  was  not  within  the  latter’s jurisdiction and the decision was never published.
The SEC considered nine complaints, regarding the denial of homebound voting, and upheld them, annulling the MEC’s decisions made in line with the SEC’s regulation.
Not all decisions were made by the SEC within the four-hour deadline for cases concerning protection of the personal right to vote.
Prior to the second round the SEC did not receive any complaints.
On election day, the SEC ruled on complaints related to the right to vote and improperly denied jurisdiction over two complaints concerning campaigning on election day.
In the latter cases, it did not issue formal rejections.
With  only  a  central  location,  the  SCPC  has  jurisdiction  over  complaints  on  violations  of  EC provisions aimed at the separation of state and party, misuse of state resources, vote-buying, and pressure on voters.
However, the SCPC informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that its effectiveness is limited due to insufficient powers and lack of cooperation from high level state bodies and law enforcement agencies.
While various OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors raised many allegations of corrupt election-related practices countrywide, few complaints on these matters were submitted to the SCPC.
Stakeholders noted that voter intimidation and vote-buying are difficult to substantiate, as witnesses were reluctant to come forward.
The SCPC received 22 election-related complaints.
It must act upon the complaints within five days of receipt, which was interpreted as a deadline to initiate deliberation of cases, not to adopt a final decision.
Most cases concerned the termination or appointment of public officials in the election period;  five  were  upheld,  and  in  one  case  evidence  of  a  politically-motivated  termination  was noted.
Several cases alleged unlawful initiation of infrastructure projects and government purchases in the election period, and use of state resources to produce campaign material.
Most were pending after the elections.
As required by law, all cases were considered in public hearings and decisions posted within 24 hours.
Due to inconsistent interpretation of the bans on government and public entities during elections, on 15 August the SCPC adopted a general opinion on what types of actions are prohibited during campaign period.
Nevertheless, the SCPC received more than 1,000 requests from state and municipal entities for opinions on whether specific budget-related actions could be taken.
Notably, despite an SCPC’s opinion that dismissal of the General Prosecutor would violate the EC, he was subsequently dismissed by parliament.
The SCPC's investigative and enforcement powers and cooperation with law enforcement in election cases  should  be  strengthened.
State  institutions  should  fully  respect  the  SCPC’s  authority.
Establishing regional SCPC offices or presence, especially in election periods, could contribute to tackling any election-related corruption.
In addition, a concrete deadline for deciding on complaints will ensure timely and effective action.
CITIZEN AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS
Contributing to the transparency of the electoral process, the EC foresees citizen and international observers’ access to all stages of the electoral process and the binding SEC Code of Conduct calls for observers’ impartiality and non-interference in the electoral process.
In a timely and inclusive process, the SEC accredited 6 citizen and 24 international observer organizations.
Citizen observers monitored the preparations for the elections and conduct of the campaign across the country, which offered a non-partisan assessment of the elections.
The SEC accredited some 3,000 citizen observers for both rounds of the elections; 2,800 from MOST and 200 from CIVIL.
Despite the absence of provisions for the second-round, the SEC allowed the submission of new lists of observers from already accredited organizations.
Electoral contestants also appointed their representatives to observe both rounds of elections.
PARTICIPATION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES
Interethnic relations played a limited role in the 2017 municipal elections.
Matters relevant to intercommunity relations did not feature prominently in the first-round campaigns.
Confrontational and at times aggressive intra-ethnic rhetoric was noted during the campaign for the second round in municipalities where parties belonging to the ruling coalition at the national level competed locally.
Most candidates and lists reflected the ethnic composition of the particular municipality.
In a few cases, candidates sought votes from across ethnic boundaries in runoffs between candidates of the same ethnicity.
In some municipalities, coalitions formed for supporting candidates in the second round differed from the national level, hence putting pressure on relations between government coalition partners.
This was the case of the alliance between the AA and BESA, most prominently in Gostivar and Struga.
Parties representing smaller ethnic communities nominated candidates in only a few municipalities where such ethnic groups are concentrated, including Turks in Centar Zhupa and Plasnica, and the Roma in Shuto Orizari.
In other localities, smaller communities presented lists of candidates for councils either through the parties representing such communities or as members of larger coalitions.
In municipalities where smaller communities’ votes are known to be decisive, candidates reached out to the voters of such ethnic groups.
Smaller ethnic parties complained to the OSCE/ODHIR EOM for not having a SEC member and being  underrepresented  in  the  MECs.
The  national  media  devoted  little  airtime  and  space  to candidates representing smaller communities and themes relevant to them were afforded limited coverage.
Further measures could be taken to facilitate minority participation in public affairs and elections.
In line with the EC requirement for an equitable representation of minorities in election management bodies, smaller communities should be better represented in election administration, both at the SEC and MEC level.
Media should provide more equitable space for political parties representing smaller communities.
Voter education and awareness campaigns, including on the right to vote without fear of retribution, should target minority communities and possibly be conducted in their languages.
ELECTION DAY (FIRST ROUND)
Early voting and election day proceeded in an orderly manner in most parts of the country; however, some procedural irregularities were observed, particularly during counting and tabulation.
Nine cases on alleged vote-buying in five municipalities were reported to the police, three of which were referred for prosecution.
Ten individuals were arrested for taking photos of their ballots.
Transparency was enhanced by the presence of party and citizen observes in 76 and 52 per cent, respectively, of polling stations observed.
In 55 per cent of EBs observed, the chairperson was a woman and overall the female members formed the majority.
OPENING AND VOTING
Early voting was conducted on 14 October for a total of 6,916 voters (some 0.3 per cent of the registered  voters),  including  voters  in  penitentiary  institutions,  internally  displaced  persons  and homebound voters.
It was negatively assessed in 14 of 96 cases observed.
Vote secrecy was compromised in 13 cases, while in 7 cases EBs did not use the ballot box.
While  voting  in  prisons  was  well  organized  and  knowledgeable  EB  staff  followed  prescribed procedures, many inmates were not able to vote as they either were not included in the voter list or their ID had expired.
Countrywide more than 900 voters in penal institutions could neither inspect the list  during  the  public  scrutiny  period  nor  was  renewal  of  their  IDs  facilitated  by  the  relevant institutions.
These voters were thus disenfranchised.
To guarantee that eligible voters in penitentiary institutions are able to exercise their right to vote, those authorities responsible for compiling the lists of voters in these institutions should ensure that all  eligible  voters  are  included  on  the  voter  list  and  have  an  opportunity  to  renew  expired identification documents.
On 15 October, the opening was assessed as good or very good in 75 of 82 polling stations observed.
Most polling stations opened on time or with a slight delay and some minor procedural irregularities were observed.
In 14 cases, protocols were not filled in before opening; and in 5 observations, party observers were interfering in the process.
Voting  was  assessed  positively  in  94  per  cent  of  polling  stations  observed.
The  most  frequent irregularities included family/group and proxy voting (8 and 2 per cent, respectively), improperly sealed ballot boxes (2 per cent), and attempts to influence voter’s choice (1 per cent).
The layout of polling stations did not sufficiently protect vote secrecy in 2 per cent of observations.
The SEC received requests from more than 10 MECs seeking instructions on how to address irregularities; several involved EB members giving voters multiple ballot papers.
In 3 per cent of observations party observers were interfering in the work of the EBs; some were reportedly tracking voters at the polling stations.
All OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors opined that political parties and contestants should refrain from interfering in the work of the EBs and strictly follow their role.
Voters could not find their names on voter lists in 9 per cent of polling stations observed.
The SEC received more than 45 complaints regarding the denial of the right to vote; mainly by citizens not on the list due to expired IDs.
Most were rejected as the list cannot be amended after its finalization.
COUNTING AND TABULATION
Counting was assessed as efficient and transparent in 69 out of 78 polling stations observed; however, in 9 cases, prescribed procedures were not followed, in 15 cases, EBs did not properly invalidate unused ballots and did not determine the number of voters who voted.
In 11 cases, unauthorized persons counted ballots.
In 12 cases, EBs faced difficulties in completing protocols.
One third of EBs observed did not display result protocols for public scrutiny.
During  tabulation,  in  65  out  of  71  MECs  observed,  most  procedures  were  followed.
However, deficiencies in transparency (3 cases), insufficient space (12 cases) and disorganization (6 cases) prolonged the process in 6 MECs.
In 14 MECs, observers did not have a sufficient view of the data entry process, which limited transparency.
During counting for both rounds, the validity of ballots was determined according to a SEC decision.
In contradiction with the EC and international good practice, it required EBs to invalidate certain ballots on which the intent of the voter was clear.
This, in addition to a lack of provisions for spoiled  and  blank  ballots,  contributed  to  the  high  number  of  invalid  ballots.
Good  practice recommends making an attempt to “ascertain the voter’s intention.” 128 The number of invalid ballots decreased from 4.2 per cent in the first round to 2.8 per cent in the second, probably because voters were marking only one ballot paper in the second round.
MECs tabulated the results, entering the data from the EB’s protocols in the unified electronic result management system.
The SEC did not detail procedures for correcting mistakes in protocols, its instructions lacked clarity and the corrected results protocols were not made public.
In addition, MECs  entered  data  with  numerical  discrepancies  in  the  results,  leading  to  significant  disparity between the ballots cast and the number of voters who voted.
Furthermore, provisions on uploading the results protocols and publishing them online are not provided for.
To ensure transparency and trust in the electoral process, all actual results protocols including those corrected later in the process should be uploaded online.
Detailed procedures for correction of results protocols at the MEC should be provided.
Preliminary results are required to be published within 7 hours after the end of voting and within 10 hours for the City of Skopje.
While some MECs complied with the short deadline, 49 MECs with more polling stations to process were unable to post results on time.
Due to the improper packing of votes  from  prisons  and  logistical  problems  in  delivering  votes  from  prisons  to  the  relevant municipalities, the results for the municipalities of Skopje were posted on the SEC website only on 17 October.
The SEC announced preliminary voter turnout at 60 per cent.
ELECTION DAY (SECOND ROUND)
Early voting and election day were overall well managed.
However, procedural irregularities observed during the counting detracted from the positive assessment.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM is aware of five cases initiated by the police on voters taking photos of their ballots.
Two cases of vote-buying in a Skopje  municipality  were  referred  for  prosecution.
A  robust  police  presence  around  polling locations in some municipalities was noted.
Partisan and citizen observers were present in 92 and 54 per cent, respectively, of polling stations observed.
In 53 per cent of observations, EBs were chaired by women.
OPENING AND VOTING
Early voting on 28 October was positively assessed in all 9 prisons and in 40 of 44 observations of homebound voting.
Observers’ negative assessments were attributed to compromised vote secrecy and the absence of the ballot box.
On election day, opening was positively assessed in 44 of 45 polling stations observed.
The integrity of the process was not affected by a number of observed minor procedural irregularities.
In five cases, protocols were not filled in, and in one municipality, the number of registered voters printed on EBs protocols was incorrect; the SEC was required to correct the error.
Voting was positively assessed in 97 per cent of polling stations observed.
However, tensions outside some polling stations due to the presence of party activists were observed in two municipalities.
Observed procedural irregularities included family voting (6 per cent), compromised vote secrecy (2 per cent), and partisan observers overstepping their mandate (2 per cent).
Following requests, the SEC advised three MECs on how to address various irregularities.
Braille ballot templates were available in 62 per cent of polling stations observed, a notable increase compared with the first round of elections where it was noted in only 8 per cent of observations.
However, as during the first round, more than half of polling stations observed were not wheelchair-accessible.
Positively, wheelchair-accessible voting booths were provided in more than two thirds of polling stations observed.
To encourage equal participation of persons with disabilities in elections, the election administration should take further measures to improve the accessibility of polling stations.
COUNTING AND TABULATION
Polling stations closed on time and most EBs followed closing procedures.
However, counting was negatively assessed in 8 of 44 observations.
In 14 cases, EBs did not properly determine the number of voters who voted, and in 9 cases, they did not count unused ballots.
More than half of EBs observed did not display results protocols, undermining transparency.
The tabulation of results was efficient and transparent in all 35 MECs observed.
The centralized result management system operated properly in all but one MEC.
In 16 MECs, a number of EB results protocols with numerical errors were corrected, indicating insufficient training on how to complete them.
Official complaints were erroneously filed at six MECs, rather than with the SEC, as provided in the law.
The SEC started publishing preliminary results online, by polling station, shortly after the closing of the polls.
Unlike during the first round, the legal deadline was respected, and an improvement in the accuracy of the published results was observed.
Voter turnout was announced at 51.92 per cent.
POST-ELECTION DAY DEVELOPMENTS
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS
The SEC certified municipal election on 14 November.
Among the elected mayors, 57 represent SDSM, 10 are from DUI, 5 from VMRO-DPMNE, 3 from AA, 1 from BESA, 1 from DPA, 1 from Democratic Party of Turks in Macedonia (DPTM) and 3 independents; among the elected, six are women  representing  only  7.4  per  cent  of  all  mayors.
Council  elections  countrywide  were predominantly won by the SDSM (41 per cent), VMRO-DPMNE (32 per cent), followed by DUI (10 per  cent),  BESA  (5  per  cent),  AA  (5  per  cent),  DPA  (1  per  cent),  other  smaller  parties  and independent candidates (4 and 3 per cent respectively).
In total, 455 women were elected, representing 33.7 per cent of the councillors.
The post-electoral atmosphere was generally calm and a peaceful transition of power occurred.
The municipal councillors and mayors who won in the first round, received their certificates from the respective MECs and commenced their official duties from 18 October.
The mayors elected in the second round took office from 1 November.
Overall, the 2017 municipal elections were perceived as  an  important  milestone  in  building  the  new  government’s  credibility  and  contributed  to strengthening confidence in the democratic process.
The SDSM party leader declared the elections as free, democratic and peaceful, while the DUI leader stated his party’s mayors would serve all citizens irrespective of their ethnicity.
At the same time the VMRO-DPMNE declared that it would not recognize the election results as these were the worst elections organized since the country’s independence, marred with large scale voter coercion and violence.
The VMRO-DPMNE proposed a seven-point plan to restore democracy.
The AA leader stated he would recognize all results except in Struga, where he lost.
COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
The SEC is mandated to adjudicate complaints concerning irregularities in the voting, counting and tabulation processes, and challenges to the results.
These SEC decisions can be appealed to the Administrative Court.
Contestants have the right to submit complaints within 48 hours from the publication of preliminary results.
However, the SEC announced a unified deadline, not considering the actual time when each MEC published its results.
This significantly shortened the timeframe for some complaints and undermined the right to seek an effective legal redress.
In addition, the deadline set by the SEC for deciding complaints contradicted and shortened the legal deadline.
For the  first  round,  the  SEC  was  unable  to  meet  the  48-hour  deadline  for  adjudicating  all  the complaints.
Unduly strict provisions require the SEC to annul polling station results in case of any procedural irregularities, including minor ones, and even if the irregularity would not affect the results.
This could lead to disenfranchisement of voters and is contrary to good practice.
The EC does not sufficiently establish what types of evidence will be considered as probative of the issues to be decided in the adjudication of disputes and the holding of recounts is not regulated.
In addition, for these elections the SEC amended its complaints procedure to include a provision that complaints will be denied consideration if the results protocols do not have a remark about the alleged irregularity by the complainant’s representative.
This provision contradicts the EC and takes a technical approach that undermines the prospect of remedying legitimate complaints.
Provisions for annulment of polling station results should be amended to provide for annulments only where violations might impact the overall results.
The law should establish clear and reasonable rules for evidence in complaints, and these should be objectively and consistently applied.
The SEC received 46 post first-round complaints, the vast majority lodged by VRMO-DPMNE, and 100 complaints were lodged after the second round, almost all by BESA and AA.
Complaints, which requested annulment of results, alleged various irregularities that fall within the established grounds for annulment of polling station results.
The SEC rejected all complaints in both rounds.
Members decided the cases along political lines, in contravention of a requirement of impartiality, and the lack of organization and professionalism hindered the process.
Formalistic and discretionary approaches were taken with the apparent aim to identify reasons to reject cases, as opposed to delivering an effective legal remedy.
While many cases were substantively examined in the first round, thoroughness varied and in the second round the extent of examination significantly diminished.
Many  cases were rejected using arbitrary and unreasonable rules of evidence, and some decisions lacked a clear and sound legal basis.
Several cases were denied substantive consideration on technical grounds, with disregard for protection of electoral rights and at odds with international good practice.
While all cases were decided in open session and complaints and decisions promptly published on the SEC website, adding to transparency, the overall manner in which complaints were handled challenged the rule of law and due process, contrary to OSCE commitments.
Twenty-eight of SEC’s decisions on post-first round complaints and nearly all decisions on second round complaints were appealed to the Administrative Court, almost all within the short 24-hour deadline.
The cases were decided by five-judge panels, randomly selected, with cases assigned by a computer system.
As a general rule, public hearings are not held in the Administrative Court, limiting transparency and public trust in election dispute resolution and contrary to the constitution and OSCE commitments.
However, the court held open sessions to provide information about the cases, as required by the EC.
Its decisions were made within the 48-hour deadline and published.
All first-round appeals were unanimously rejected and all but one second round cases were rejected, leaving substantiated cases without an effective remedy.
Three decisions from the second-round appeals were not unanimous with a vote of four against one, all adopted by the same panel of judges on complaints lodged by the same party; the decisions did not state which judges voted for and against, contrary to the EC.
The one partially satisfied case resulted in the annulment of the voting in a polling station in Chair.
As the annulment affected the results, a repeat voting in the respective polling station was held on 12 November, in accordance with the law.
SEC members and administrative court judges should decide complaints with complete impartiality, strictly applying the law and due process.
A technical approach to complaints should be avoided.
To increase transparency, public court hearings in all election-related cases should be guaranteed.
RECOMMENDATIONS
These recommendations, contained throughout the text, are offered to further enhance the conduct of elections  in  the  host  country  and  to  support  efforts  to  bring  them  fully  in  line  with  OSCE commitments,  other  international  obligations  and  standards  for  democratic  elections.
These recommendations should be read in conjunction with past OSCE/ODIHR recommendations that the host country has yet to address.
The OSCE/ODIHR stands ready to assist the authorities to further improve the electoral process and framework and address the recommendations contained in this and previous reports.
PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
The Electoral Code should be comprehensively reviewed to address identified shortcomings, gaps and ambiguities, including provisions for second round of elections, to bring it in line with OSCE commitments, international obligations and good practice.
The review and amendments should be conducted in a public procedure, after a broadly inclusive consultation process and sufficiently in advance of the next election.
The SEC should maintain a stable regulatory framework and refrain from amending the rules during an electoral period, except to address emergency matters.
The SEC should ensure that applicable rules are not contrary to or inconsistent with the EC.
Consideration could be given to introducing an expedited process for challenges to the legality of election-related legislation and regulations.
In order to increase transparency and public confidence in their work, the SEC and MECs should make their regulations, guidelines, decisions and minutes of sessions, including those related to procurement, public in a timely manner.
As previously recommended, the EC should be revised to include all eligible voters in the voter lists,  regardless  of  the  validity  of  their  identification  documents.
In  line  with  international obligations, limitations on voting rights on the basis of legal incapacity should be removed, whilst necessary support mechanisms to exercise the right to vote should be provided.
All instances and allegations of pressure, intimidation, vote-buying and misuse of administrative resources should be thoroughly and effectively investigated and prosecuted by authorities in a timely manner.
There should also be civic education aimed at alleviation of corrupt activities in election campaigns with input from respective agencies.
The legal requirement for the MRT to provide an exact amount of time in every newscast devoted to the coverage of parties’ campaign activities should be replaced with a more general requirement to allow equitable access and news coverage of smaller parties and independent candidates, as well as preserving the balance between the principle of equal opportunities among contestants, pluralism of views and journalistic freedom.
All decisions and (in)actions of the MECs and SEC should be subject to timely and effective judicial redress.
Voters and citizen observers should be entitled to file any type of election-related complaint, including against the results.
To ensure transparency and trust in the electoral process, all actual results protocols including those corrected later in the process should be uploaded online.
Detailed procedures for correction of results protocols at the MEC should be provided.
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS
ELECTION ADMINISTRATION
The  SEC  members  should  adhere  to  the  legal  requirement  of  impartiality  and  established procedures and respect the terms of reference set out for SEC members and the secretariat.
To ensure that MEC and EB members possess appropriate professional experience and/or to reduce perception of bias in the election administration, their selection process should be made more  transparent  by  publishing  the  list  of  prospective  MEC  and  EB  members,  opening  the computer programme for third party verification and facilitating observation of the process.
To improve MECs and EBs capacity and to ensure consistent conduct of elections, the SEC should provide timely and uniform trainings, in particular, on completing result protocols.
Municipalities should ensure adequate and timely financial and operational planning, providing MECs with the necessary resources well ahead of elections.
In addition, the relevant authorities should ensure that funds for any municipalities, including with blocked accounts, are transferred on time.
In order to enhance the effective exercise of voting rights, the SEC should develop and implement a comprehensive and nationwide civic and voter education programme, including for voters with various types of disabilities.
VOTER REGISTRATION
The law should provide an opportunity for all persons entitled to vote including persons in healthcare institutions, long-term care facilities and retirement homes  to exercise their  right.
Consideration should also be given to revising the regulation for homebound voting eligibility to enhance participation.
To improve the accuracy of the voter list and to facilitate voters’ participation, an update of the voter lists between the rounds should be considered.
Consideration should be given to extending the period of scrutiny of the voter lists and to bringing the deadline for changes closer to election day.
To guarantee that eligible voters in penitentiary institutions are able to exercise their right to vote, those authorities responsible for compiling the lists of voters in these institutions should ensure that all eligible voters are included on the voter list and have an opportunity to renew expired identification documents.
CANDIDATE REGISTRATION
Consideration could be given to standardising the required number of signatures for independent candidates at up to one per cent of registered voters in line with international good practice.
In addition,  as  previously  recommended,  consideration  could  be  given  to  providing  alternative methods for signature collection in order to reduce the potential for intimidation.
The EC could be revised to prohibit coalitions and lists, submitted by a group of voters, from using the same name/or logo as a registered party and to regulate the withdrawal of candidates.
Political parties should comply with the gender quota requirements set out in the EC; while the SEC and MECs should strictly enforce the legislation.
Approval of the lists should be subject to judicial review.
ELECTION CAMPAIGN
The EC should guarantee independent candidates campaign conditions on an equitable basis with other contestants.
As previously recommended, authorities should exercise greater political will to ensure sufficient separation between state and party.
It is recommended that political parties and relevant institutions take initiatives to encourage the participation of women in the electoral process and in political decision-making.
CAMPAIGN FINANCE
The EC should require interim campaign finance reports be submitted electronically and establish suitable  penalties  for  late  or  non-submission.
The  template  should  include  a  breakdown  of expenses by municipality and require reporting of incurred expenses.
In addition, the law should require the publishing of interim and final reports on the day of submission.
The SAO should be mandated to conduct a review of interim reports, and to publish its findings and refer possible violations to appropriate authorities prior to election day.
The deadline for filing final reports should be within 30 days after the election.
The law should establish the scope of audits to ensure comprehensive review against any possible infringement, and SAO granted the necessary investigatory powers.
Established penalties for all violations should be imposed.
MEDIA
To further safeguard the role of the AVMS, its members should be appointed in a manner that ensures its independence from political influence.
The  MRT  should  strengthen  its  role  as  public  broadcaster  by  improving  the  quality  of  the programmes.
It  should  promote  pluralism,  provide  a  broader  range  of  political  viewpoints, professionalise  journalism,  disseminate  voter  education  programmes  and  increase  women’s political participation by providing them with greater news coverage.
COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
Consideration could be given to the decentralization of the complaints process, and the MECs capacity to handle complaints could be strengthened.
The SEC’s functioning on legal matters could be enhanced through more effective use of its legal department.
Deadlines for submission and adjudication of complaints should be in line with international good practice.
The SCPC's investigative and enforcement powers and cooperation with law enforcement in election cases should be strengthened.
State institutions should fully respect the SCPC’s authority.
Establishing regional SCPC offices or presence, especially in election periods, could contribute to tackling  any  election-related  corruption.
In  addition,  a  concrete  deadline  for  deciding  on complaints will ensure timely and effective action.
Provisions for annulment of polling station results should be amended to provide for annulments only  where  violations  might  impact  the  overall  results.
The  law  should  establish  clear  and reasonable rules for evidence in complaints, and these should be objectively and consistently applied.
SEC  members  and  administrative  court  judges  should  decide  complaints  with  complete impartiality, strictly applying the law and due process.
A technical approach to complaints should be avoided.
To increase transparency, public court hearings in all election-related cases should be guaranteed.
NATIONAL MINORITIES
Further measures could be taken to facilitate minority participation in public affairs and elections.
In  line  with  the  EC  requirement  for  an  equitable  representation  of  minorities  in  election management bodies, smaller communities should be better represented in election administration, both at the SEC and MEC level.
Media should provide more equitable space for political parties representing smaller communities.
Voter education and awareness campaigns, including on the right to vote without fear of retribution, should target minority communities and possibly be conducted in their languages.
VOTING, COUNTING AND TABULATION
To  encourage  equal  participation  of  persons  with  disabilities  in  elections,  the  election administration should take further measures to improve the accessibility of polling stations.
ODIHR Special Election Assessment Mission Final Report
Following an invitation from the authorities of the Republic of North Macedonia and in accordance with its mandate, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) deployed a Special Election Assessment Mission (SEAM) for the 15 July early parliamentary elections.
The SEAM resumed the election observation process commenced by the ODIHR Election Observation Mission (EOM) which was suspended on 17 March following the introduction of restrictions on cross-border travel throughout the OSCE region related to the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The ODIHR SEAM assessed compliance of the electoral process with OSCE commitments, other international obligations and standards for democratic elections, as well as national legislation.
The Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions issued on 16 July concluded that the early parliamentary elections “were generally administered effectively amid adjustments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but legal stability was undermined by substantial revisions to the Electoral Code and subsequent ad hoc regulations enacted during the state of emergency.
The campaign, although negative in tone, was genuinely competitive and participants could deliver their messages despite limitations on traditional outreach.
Media coverage of the elections lacked critical assessment of platforms, whereas provisions regarding paid political advertisement favoured the three largest parties.
Election day proceeded smoothly, despite technical challenges in publishing results and concerns related to voter registration.”
Early parliamentary elections were initially scheduled for 12 April 2020, and the electoral process was subsequently suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The state of emergency announced by the president on 18 March, initially for 30 days, was extended four times and lasted until 22 June.
The election date of 15 July was determined by protracted negotiations between political parties, related to the need to reconstitute a permanent government and parliament as well as safety measures for conducting elections during the pandemic.
The elections were conducted under a legal framework that was substantially amended on the eve of the announcement of the elections, contrary to international good practice.
The introduced amendments only partially addressed some ODIHR recommendations, while long-standing recommendations pertaining to revision of electoral district boundaries by an independent body, rights of persons with disabilities, the universality and equality of the vote in the electoral district abroad, and an effective campaign finance audit remain unaddressed.
The persisting inconsistencies, gaps and ambiguous formulations underline the need for a comprehensive reform of the electoral legal framework well in advance of forthcoming elections.
The election administration, composed of the State Election Commission (SEC), Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), and Electoral Boards, operated in a largely professional manner despite complications caused by the suspension of the electoral process, the state of emergency and the adjustments necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SEC fulfilled its duties within legal deadlines and in a fairly transparent manner.
Public confidence in the election administration was partially undermined by technical challenges in the publication of results.
The authorities undertook a number of measures to adjust the electoral process to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
An additional early voting day was established to enfranchise COVID-19 positive voters and those in self-isolation.
The SEC adopted instructions outlining health protocols for different stages of the electoral process and polling station premises were reviewed to accommodate distancing requirements.
The SEC also conducted a comprehensive voter education campaign on health-related adjustments to election day procedures.
Longstanding structural issues related to the voter register, such as a lack of standardization of address data, harmonization and interoperability across institutions as well as of detailed instructions on voter registration procedures remain unaddressed.
Although the amended Electoral Code introduced a Central Population Register as a new source for the voter register, it could not be used for these elections due to incomplete data.
The SEC’s limited IT capacity combined with a recent lack of comprehensive quality control further affected the quality of the register.
Candidate registration was completed prior to the suspension of the elections, in an inclusive process.
Commendably, the SEC issued guidelines which provided a checklist for candidates and a detailed verification procedure, launched a new online application for submission of candidate lists and published all lists of candidates on its webpage with an interactive tool, which displayed candidates’ party affiliation, gender, electoral district and municipality.
A total of 12 political parties and 3 coalitions fielded 1,598 candidates on 78 lists.
These included 675 women candidates (42 per cent), and women headed 19 of 78 lists.
These candidates remained registered once the electoral process resumed following the state of emergency.
The visibility of female candidates remained low. Although women constituted 42 per cent of registered candidates, ODIHR SEAM monitoring indicates that coverage of women politicians by media varied between mere 4 and 14 per cent of candidate coverage.
Women candidates met by the ODIHR SEAM described a lack of support for prospective women leaders in internal party structures.
The campaign was marked by negative rhetoric and personal attacks between party leaders, at the expense of substantive exchanges.
Leaking of a series of clandestine recordings of political leaders further contributed to the negative tone.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the style of campaign as series of government decrees outlined safety measures to be applied at public meetings.
Parties replaced traditional rallies with small-scale meetings and limited door-to-door canvassing.
Despite the circumstances, parties campaigned actively and were able to deliver their messages.
The ODIHR SEAM noted isolated cases of ministers from different parties blurring their state functions and political activities.
Political parties also reported to the ODIHR SEAM cases of pressure on public officials, especially in the west of the country, including attempts to instrumentalize the police.
The legal framework on campaign financing requires further harmonisation to eliminate gaps and inconsistencies.
The agencies tasked with campaign finance oversight lack capacity due to insufficient budgeting and human resources, which undermined their control over the accountability and transparency of campaign financing.
Most political parties assessed the interim reporting framework as superfluous and burdensome, and not all contestants submitted all interim reports, despite a legal requirement.
As the SEC did not consistently publish contestants’ reports, and the third-party reports were not published, transparency was lacking.
All ODIHR SEAM interlocutors noted that significant improvements in media freedoms in recent years were not reinforced by systematic reforms in the media sector, such as ensuring the political neutrality of the public broadcaster and the media regulator.
The legal framework for the allocation of funds for paid time, and the distribution of maximum limits for paid political advertisements, was modified by a government decree enacted on 22 June, the last day of the state of emergency.
The provisions favoured three bigger parties, which were together legally granted the amounts and time allocations several times greater than the other twelve contestants combined.
During the official campaign period all national terrestrial broadcasters largely focused their coverage on mutual accusations between leaders of major political parties, while in-depth analytical reporting or policybased discussions were largely absent.
The majority of election-related complaints are within the jurisdiction of the SEC, except complaints related to campaign and political finance and misuse of administrative resources, which lay within the jurisdiction of the State Commission for Prevention of Corruption (SCPC).
The SCPC established violations in two of six complaints alleging abuse of state resources, one of which was eventually overturned by the Administrative Court in appeal.
The SEC rejected all complaints on early campaigning as well as complaints on electoral irregularities and elections results as unsubstantiated by evidence or inadmissible since the alleged violation occurred during the state of emergency which suspended the electoral process.
The new competence exercised by MECs to examine complaints during early voting and on election day resulted in dual jurisdiction with the SEC for some complaints, and some election day complaints remained unexamined by the SEC.
Restrictions on the right to challenge electoral irregularities and results, as well as a formalistic approach to the review of complaints, did not ensure the effective legal remedy.
The ODIHR SEAM did not undertake systematic or comprehensive observation of early voting and election-day proceedings, although on 15 July it did visit a limited number of polling stations.
Early voting and election day itself generally proceeded in an orderly manner and without major incidents or tension.
On election night, the SEC reported a cyber-attack, which caused the SEC’s website to crash.
The publication of election results was affected by technical challenges.
The SEC conducted additional tabulation of results on the basis of hard copies of the final protocols, but the technical problems led to speculations about the transparency of the process and, eventually, to official investigations.
This report offers a number of recommendations to support efforts to bring elections in North Macedonia further in line with OSCE commitments and other international obligations and standards for democratic elections.
Priority recommendations relate to reform of legal framework, harmonization of data for voter register, increased capacity of the campaign finance oversight institutions, unimpeded access to paid political advertisement, and cyber-security of electoral process.
ODIHR stands ready to assist the authorities to improve the electoral process and to address the recommendations contained in this and prior reports.
Following an invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the Republic of North Macedonia, and in accordance with its mandate, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), on 19 June deployed a Special Election Assessment Mission (SEAM) headed by Laima Andrikienė.
The ODIHR SEAM consisted of a core team of nine international experts, who were based in Skopje and visited Aračinovo, Gostivar, Ilinden, Kumanovo, Lipkovo, Tetovo, and Vrapčište.
The electoral process was assessed for compliance with OSCE commitments, other international obligations and standards for democratic elections, and with national legislation.
The SEAM did not carry out systematic or comprehensive observation of the voting, counting and tabulation proceedings on election day, in line with ODIHR’s methodology for election assessment missions.
Mission members did, however, visit a limited number of polling stations on election day.
The ODIHR EAM wishes to thank the MFA and the State Election Commission (SEC) for their cooperation and assistance, as well as to express gratitude to representatives of other state institutions, election commissions, political parties, candidates, media, civil society, academia, the resident diplomatic community, and other interlocutors for sharing their views.
Early parliamentary elections were initially scheduled for 12 April 2020.
The decision to call early elections was precipitated by the European Council’s decision in October 2019 not to open negotiations on the country’s accession to the European Union (EU), which prompted the government to resign.
On 3 January 2020, the prime minister resigned and, in line with the 2015 Przino Agreement, a caretaker government including opposition ministers took office for the 100 days preceding the scheduled elections.
On 16 February, the parliamentary speaker dissolved the parliament and called elections for 12 April, some eight months before the expiration of the parliamentary term.
Amid the global outbreak of COVID-19, on 18 March the president declared a 30-day state of emergency, and on 21 March the elections were suspended by a governmental decree, which provided that the electoral process would resume from the day the state of emergency was lifted.
The state of emergency, which granted the caretaker government extraordinary legislative powers, was extended four times, on the final occasion for only eight days for the purpose of re-scheduling the elections.
A number of challenges to the legitimacy of presidential decisions introducing a state of emergency without parliamentary approval and of the legislative powers vested in the government were brought to the Constitutional Court (see also Complaints and Appeals).
The election date of 15 July was determined following protracted negotiations between political parties, focused on the need to reconstitute a regular government and parliament and safety measures for conducting elections during the pandemic.
These were the fifth consecutive early parliamentary elections since 2008, and many interlocutors described political and economic ramifications of this instability.
The previous parliamentary elections were held in December 2016, when six parties and coalitions gained representation in the parliament.
Although the coalition led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE) won more seats, a new government was formed in April 2017 by a coalition that was led by the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) and included the mainly ethnic-Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
In general, women are under-represented in public life.
Measures in the Electoral Code to promote female candidates in party lists boosted the representation of women in the outgoing parliament, with 47 women out of 120 MPs.
However, women are less visible in the executive.
Only 5 of 24 ministers in the outgoing government were women, and only 6 of 81 mayors.
While the elections were on hold, key developments took place in the EU and NATO accession processes.
On 24 March, the EU’s General Affairs Council approved the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia, and on 27 March the country formally became a member of the NATO alliance.


The parliament is a unicameral body comprising 120 to 123 members that is directly elected for a four-year term under a proportional representation model using closed lists.
Seats are allocated to candidate lists according to the D’Hondt method of highest average.
Twenty members of parliament (MPs) are elected from each of the six in-country electoral districts, and up to three MPs are elected from a single out-of-country electoral district.
The number of MPs elected in the district abroad is conditioned by a threshold linked to the previous election results without a correlation to voter turnout, which was previously criticized by ODIHR and the Venice Commission for failing to comply with the principle of universal suffrage.
North Macedonia has ratified key international and regional human rights instruments pertaining to the holding of democratic elections.
The legal framework for the conduct of parliamentary elections includes the 1991 Constitution (last amended in 2019), the 2006 Electoral Code (last amended in February 2020), the 2004 Law on Political Parties, the 2004 Law on Financing Political Parties (amended in 2018), and regulations adopted by the SEC to supplement the law.
The elections were conducted under a legal framework substantially amended on the eve of the announcement of the elections, contrary to international good practice.
Amendments introduced into the Electoral Code in February 2020 partially addressed some ODIHR recommendations on issues such as voter registration, transparency of election dispute resolution, deadlines for campaign finance reporting, and campaign oversight.
Still, some ODIHR recommendations remain unaddressed, including those on the rights of persons with disabilities, recruitment and dismissal procedures of election administration members, campaign finance rules, an effective campaign finance audit and sanctioning.
The majority of SEAM interlocutors, including the SEC, state agencies, and political parties, underlined the need for a comprehensive reform of electoral legislation.
The persisting inconsistencies, gaps, expired and inapplicable provisions, and ambiguous formulations in the legal framework undermine legal certainty and require further substantive revision.
Inconsistent regulations include the norms on maintenance and modification of the voter register, unaligned deadlines for voter and candidate registration, campaigning and related deadlines, determination of prices for political advertising and distribution of political advertising quotas among campaign participants, compensation for campaign expenditures, reporting on in-kind contributions for campaign purposes, scope of financial reporting, closure of campaign accounts, division of disputeresolution competencies between election management bodies.
The new provisions on fingerprinting during voter identification require revision to ensure that the procedures pursue a legitimate aim and include data protection requirements.
Provisions related to budgetary compensation of campaign expenditure are no longer valid, as these entitlements were repealed, and need to be abolished.
The February 2020 changes to the Electoral Code were adopted under an expedited procedure, without general debate, contrary to previous ODIHR recommendations and parliamentary Rules of Procedure.
The proposals of an inter-agency working group tasked with amending the Electoral Code were not incorporated.
The hasty adoption hampered the effective implementation of the amendments, as some previous regulatory deficiencies were not eliminated, and administrative capacity and infrastructure were not always ensured.
The Electoral Code should be comprehensively reviewed in order to harmonize it internally and with other relevant laws, to bring it in line with OSCE commitments, international obligations and good practice.
The revision should be done in a public procedure, after a broadly inclusive consultation process and sufficiently in advance of the next elections in order to guarantee legal certainty.
The Electoral Code allows up to five per cent deviation from the average number of voters per electoral district.
Wider disparities existed in four districts.
The February 2020 amendments to the Electoral Code altered the boundaries of two districts, moving two municipalities, Debar and Mavrovo-Rostuse, from electoral district six to district five.
Despite deviation in excess of the legal limit in districts three and four, these district boundaries remained unchanged.
To ensure equality of the vote, legislation should foresee periodic review of district boundaries by an independent body.
When district boundaries are redefined, it should be done in a timely, transparent, impartial and inclusive manner under a clear and consistent methodology.
Despite interpretation by the Constitutional Court that legislative powers of the government during a state of emergency shall be calibrated to the specific needs, the binding governmental decrees covered a vast area of public life, including electoral procedures within the competence of institutions under the Electoral Code, substituting the decisions of these institutions.
The decrees regulated the resumption and conduct of the electoral process, the validity of previously completed procedures, voter registration, campaigning in the media, and established standards and procedures for compliance with health protocols, including an additional voting day for COVID-19 positive voters and those in self-isolation.
The governmental regulations on indoor and outdoor events was amended multiple times and lacked consistency and consolidation, undermining legal certainty and implementation.
Overall, the constant generation of amendments to the decrees diminished the general understanding of their substance and validity.


The elections were administered by a three-tiered structure led by the SEC and supported by a secretariat and 34 regional offices, 80 Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), and 3,480 Electoral Boards (EBs).
The SEC is the highest electoral authority with regulatory, monitoring and oversight powers, responsible for organizing and supervising elections and referenda.
The Commission’s mandate, initially envisioned for six months to administer the 2018 referendum, was extended twice; first in November 2018 for up to two years and consequently, on the basis of a government decree issued on 21 March 2020, until six months from the holding of the 2020 parliamentary elections.
To ensure the stability and professionalism of the election administration, the tenure of the State Election Commissioners’ mandate should be clearly stipulated by the Electoral Code.
The Code should also provide for a clear and transparent procedure of nomination and appointment of electoral commissioners.
The election administration carried out its duties within legal deadlines, despite complications caused by the suspension of the electoral process and concerns raised publicly by the SEC during the state of emergency in relation to the electoral calendar.
ODIHR SEAM interlocutors generally expressed satisfaction with the effectiveness of the SEC, though some questioned the partisan structure of the commission.
The SEC adopted decisions in a collegial manner, often featuring substantive debate, in sessions which were open to observers and were live-streamed on the website of the state-run Macedonian Information Agency (MIA) and on the SEC’s Facebook page.
The sessions were often preceded by the SEC’s closed informal sittings, at which draft decisions were discussed.
At some sessions, sign-language interpretation was provided, enhancing the availability of information to persons with hearing impairments.
Most SEC sessions were announced with short notice, decisions and minutes were published on the SEC website, generally in a timely manner, but the minutes’ publication ceased with the SEC session held on 9 July.
The February 2020 amendments to the Electoral Code redistributed some key responsibilities among election commissions and state agencies and assigned a wide array of new competencies to the SEC.
These new tasks include investigating alleged violations and examining evidence in dispute resolution mechanisms, initiating actions on electoral irregularities ex officio, and determining pricing for political advertisements in broadcast, print and online media (see the Complaints and Appeals and Media sections, respectively).
The SEC informed ODIHR that it lacks the legal guidelines and institutional capacity to adequately perform these duties and opined that specialized professional bodies would be better equipped for handling them.
The SEC’s Secretariat remains understaffed, contrary to prior ODIHR recommendations.
For the electoral period, the SEC resorts to a practice of strengthening its human resources through secondments of additional temporary personnel from other state institutions.
The solution continues to undermine the effectiveness of preparations and resilience to respond to unanticipated challenges when they arise.
Moreover, the SEAM received reports that some secondments were politically affiliated.
Essential personnel should be employed in the State Election Commission’s secretariat on a permanent basis.
The capacity of the secretariat’s human resources should match the powers vested to the Commission pursuant to the Electoral Code.
Appointed in 2016 for a five-year term, the MECs are responsible for administering elections in their respective municipalities.
They are composed of five randomly selected civil servants and their deputies.
MECs are responsible for overseeing the electoral process in each municipality, and their duties include registration of candidates, appointment and training of EBs, tabulation and announcement of municipal results, as well as other technical preparations under the guidance of the SEC.
EB members were selected in 2017 for a term of four years.
The ruling political parties and the parties in opposition that won the most votes in the last parliamentary elections each nominate for every election one temporary EB member and their deputies; the remaining three EB members are randomly selected from a database of state employees.
According to the Electoral Code, the composition of each election management body must respect legal requirements for ethnic and gender representation.
Members of each gender should comprise at least 30 per cent of all MECs and EBs.
Women held 45 per cent of seats in MECs, and 32 per cent of MECs were chaired by women.
The gender-disaggregated data on the EBs composition was not readily available.
Equitable representation of ethnic communities is required for all MECs and EBs in municipalities in which at least 20 per cent of the population are members of such communities.
The database of state employees maintained by the Ministry of Information Society and Administration (MISA) is outdated and slowed the process of replacing a significant number of EB members.
The replacements were necessitated first by a government decision in March to retract some 3,200 medical staff in response to COVID-19 needs, and subsequently by the resignation of a comparable number of additional MEC and EB members who generally cited COVID-19 concerns or health status.
While these complications did not appear to affect the election day, they unnecessarily increased the workload of the SEC staff during electoral preparations.
Furthermore, some of the state institutions involved in the electoral process, such as the State Audit Office (SAO), informed the SEAM that their employees are included in the database and are obliged to serve in MECs and EBs, which could potentially impact institutional capacity.
If retained as a tool for the selection of election commission members, the Ministry of Information Society and Administration should update its database of public employees, engaging the respective institutions.
The authorities could consider revising the pool of state bodies from which public employees are called to serve on election commissions.
The limited number of MECs visited by the ODIHR SEAM demonstrated an overall solid knowledge of their responsibilities as well as an understanding of and commitment to implementation of the COVID-19 prevention measures in the electoral process.
Some municipal commissioners met by the ODIHR SEAM asserted that MECs are not the correct bodies to examine complaints about voting rights violations during early voting and on election day, because of their intermittent functioning and the lack of mandate related to voters’ list accuracy.
The MECs met by the SEAM indicated that they shared notices of public sessions and posted related minutes at the entrance of their respective municipal buildings.
On 22 June, the Ministry of Health Commission for Infectious Diseases endorsed a health protocol for administration of the election day procedures.
Development of the document was preceded by consultations with the SEC and civil society organizations, although according to several interlocutors these consultations were limited, and recommendations were not fully incorporated.
On the basis of the protocol, the SEC also approved instructions on voting day procedures, as well as on registration and voting for COVID-19 positive voters in quarantine and those in self-isolation, and related protective instructions for election officials.
However, a gap in the training schedule caused by the suspension of the elections created challenges in assuring systematic training on health-related procedures to all commission members; the SEC arranged some complimentary trainings.
The SEC reviewed polling station premises to accommodate distancing requirements envisaged by the protocols, though acknowledged that in many cases compliance was not possible due to lack of adequate available sites.
The SEC also formed 67 special EBs, to conduct early voting on 13 July for COVID-19 positive voters and those in self-isolation.
The SEC faced substantial challenges in forming the special EBs, composition of which included three healthcare workers and two political party representatives.
Of 300 health workers initially selected to work on the boards, over a third requested an exemption.
Positively, the SEC conducted a comprehensive voter education campaign that informed on healthrelated adjustments to election day procedures, and which was disseminated in several languages in both traditional and online media.
It also set up a telephone hotline for citizens to request information or to leave a comment on the conduct of elections, including a video hot line for citizens with hearing impairments.
According to the Constitution, citizens aged 18 years or older by election day have the right to vote, but those deprived of legal capacity by a court decision on the basis of intellectual or psychosocial disability are disenfranchised, contrary to international obligations and prior ODIHR recommendations.
The legal framework should be harmonized with international standards, by removing any restrictions on electoral rights on the basis of intellectual or psychosocial disability.
Voter registration is regulated by the Constitution, the Electoral Code, and temporary provisions but no clarity exists for detailed and permanent regulations.
Two rulebooks providing methodologies on voter list maintenance, update and access were approved in 2016.
Currently one of the methodologies is no longer applied and the other, although applied, triggers contradictory opinions about its legal validity.
Although the February 2020 revisions to the Electoral Code introduced Central Population Register as a new source from which voter registration data is to be provided to the SEC, it could not be used for these elections for it still lacks complete pictures and addresses.
In order to ensure a comprehensive regulatory framework, the Election Code should be revised to clarify and consolidate permanent detailed instructions on voter registration procedures.
Requirements in the Code should correspond to the functionality of the central population register.
The SEC was responsible for compiling the voter register on the basis of passive and regular updates provided by the Ministry of Interior (MoI), the Office for Management of Registers of Birth, Marriages and Death, and the courts.
Organization of out-of-country voting is based on active registration requiring a threshold equal to the votes needed to win a seat in the last elections.
The outof-country registration process was completed on 17 March, prior to the suspension of the elections, and the threshold, established for these elections at 6,534 registered voters, was not met.
On 1 July, the voter list was closed, and included 1,814,263 citizens, of whom 83,054 were registered as temporarily residing abroad and recorded on a separate a list that is provided to all EBs.
In addition, the SEC registered 10,882 requests for early voting on 14 July at home, care institutions or penitentiaries, and 759 voters who were COVID-19 positive or in self-isolation for early voting on 13 July.
In line with previous ODIHR recommendations, the MoI provided the SEC with a list of voters whose ID cards expired between the announcement of the elections and the election day, enhancing the inclusivity of the voter register.
On 16 June, the MoI provided SEC with the second list produced after the public inspection with voters that requested and collected their new ID; only the latter was considered by the Commission.
Thus, citizens with expired IDs and who did not receive new ones before 16 June were disenfranchised.
Pursuant to February 2020 amendments, in order to receive a ballot, all voters need to present a valid ID or a passport.
To facilitate the exercise of voting rights, additional measures could be considered to enfranchise first time voters without ID cards, citizens whose IDs expire shortly before the call for elections and citizens who do not collect a new ID before the voter list is updated by the SEC.
Before the suspension of the electoral process the public inspection of the voter list was completed and copies were subsequently submitted to all political parties.
While the new electoral calendar allowed for updates regarding deceased persons and citizens turning 18, no new special period of public inspection was introduced.
The continuous update mechanism remained available via a webbased engine allowing queries by ID number, family name and address.
Citizens and political parties could request changes to the voters register (i.e. addition, removal or modification of any data) affecting other citizens, but SEC templates applicable for public inspection limit such changes to cases of death, loss of citizenship and deprivation of legal capacity, contrary to the Electoral Code provisions.
No individual notification is issued to citizens whose data have been modified.
Many ODIHR SEAM interlocutors raised concerns regarding the accuracy of the voter list, generally noting that the number of registered voters exceeds the number of citizens with permanent residence, thereby inflating abstention.
Longstanding structural issues, as identified in prior ODIHR reports, remain unaddressed.
Addresses are managed by municipalities together with a central register, but no standardization exists.
Data sent to the SEC by various institutions is presented in various formats, hampering interoperability.
Inconsistencies also stem from the fact that hospitals do not provide systematic updates on deceased.
The voter register was further affected by SEC’s limited IT capacity, and no comprehensive quality controls took place recently on a regular basis.
The Voter Information Management System, which would allow the SEC to assume tasks that right now are undertaken by the State Statistical Office (SSO) and to increase the SEC ownership on IT aspects, is still being developed.
In line with previous ODIHR recommendations, more attention should be paid to harmonization of data supplied to the voter register, namely interoperability of received data and standardization of the address system.
Quality audits of the register should be undertaken and made public on a regular basis.
Citizens of at least 18 years of age who have the right to vote are eligible to stand as candidates, thereby excluding those whose legal capacity has been revoked on the basis of intellectual or psychosocial disability, at odds with international obligations and prior ODIHR recommendations.
The legal framework further removes candidature rights from those currently serving a sentence of more than six months of imprisonment.
Limitations on the right to stand as a candidate should be reviewed to ensure that disqualification based on a conviction is proportionate to the gravity of the offense.
Candidates could be nominated by registered political parties and coalitions, as well as by groups of voters.
Candidates nominated by voters must collect at least 1,000 supporting signatures of voters residing in the respective district.
For the first time, addressing a previous ODIHR recommendation, supporting signatures of voters could be collected at notaries’ offices in addition to the authorized locations in front of SEC employees at regional SEC offices.
Although the Electoral Code does not specify a list of documentation required for candidate nomination, the SEC issued guidelines, which provided a checklist for candidates and a detailed verification procedure.
For these elections, the SEC also launched a new online application for submission of candidate lists.
Candidate registration took place from 12 to 20 March, prior to the suspension of the electoral process.
By the end of the registration period, no group of voters successfully nominated a list, as none met the signature requirement.
The SEC registered 12 political parties and 3 coalitions fielding a total of 1,598 candidates on 78 lists.
Commendably, the SEC published all lists of candidates on its webpage with an interactive tool, which displayed candidates’ party affiliation, gender, electoral district and municipality.
On each list at least one candidate of each gender must be placed in every third place on the list, with an additional candidate of the lesser represented gender in every ten.
All submitted lists met the required 40 per cent quota; some exceeded the threshold.
In total, 675 registered candidates (42 per cent) were women, and women headed 19 of 78 lists.
The highest number of lists led by women – four out of six – was registered by “Voice for Macedonia”.
The SDSM lists for each electoral district featured a woman and a man as the first two candidates, but woman was placed on the first position only in one case.
VMRO-DPMNE’s lists were led by women in two districts.
The originally scheduled 12 April elections were suspended before the official campaign period had begun.
Following the recommencement of the electoral process, the campaign opened on 24 June and ended at midnight on 12 July, prior to the first day of early voting.
The Electoral Code prohibits campaigning between the deadline for registering candidates (on 20 March) and the start of the official campaign. Political parties engaged in some campaign activities before the moratorium.
The SDSM held a party congress on 9 March, while the VMRO-DPMNE organised events on 11 March to present their candidates and coalition partners.
Preparations for the campaign were already substantially curtailed before the suspension of the elections on 21 March.
On 10 March the government introduced a prohibition on public gatherings and events with more than 1,000 participants, both outdoors and indoors.
Following a meeting of party leaders on 12 March, the parties agreed to refrain from holding campaign rallies.
Following the recommencement of the electoral process, allegations were raised with the ODIHR SEAM that senior political figures engaged in early campaign activity before 24 June.
In some cases, these allegations appeared to be justified, although the situation was ambiguous given that the electoral process was suspended during the state of emergency.
The rules on early campaigning lead to the anomalous situation in which would-be candidates and their parties carry out political activities until their formal registration, and are then obliged to cease campaigning until the start of the campaign period, while others not directly involved in the elections would be allowed to continue their activities throughout.
Consideration should be given to aligning the official campaign period with the timeline for registration of contestants, to ensure campaign regulations apply consistently to all.
Regular political activities before the official campaign period should not be prohibited and should be regulated.
A series of government decrees and decisions during and after the state of emergency outlined safety measures to be applied at public meetings, including the use of hand sanitizer, social distancing and mask-wearing.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the style of campaign as parties adopted additional measures, for the most part eschewing traditional rallies in favour of small-scale meetings as well as limited door-to-door canvassing and other activities to meet with voters.
Despite the circumstances, parties campaigned actively and were able to deliver their messages.
The campaign took place in a calm environment and, notwithstanding isolated cases of campaign posters being vandalised, the freedom of expression was respected.
Contestants relied extensively on social media, posting videos of local meetings addressed by candidates and party leaders.
Numerous campaign advertisements were aired in broadcast and social media and billboards were widely visible.
Key campaign issues included the economy, judicial reform, social welfare and healthcare.
The SDSM stressed its record in advancing NATO and EU accession. Responding to claims by its opponents that it had “sold out” the national interest, the SDSM asserted that, in signing a friendship agreement with Bulgaria in 2017 and the Prespa agreement with Greece in 2018, the government had defended the national identity and language.
The campaign was marked by negative rhetoric, at the expense of substantive exchanges.
The advertisements of VMRO-DPMNE included personal attacks on the leader of the SDSM.
For its part, the SDSM warned of a return to the “regime” of the former VMRO-DPMNE prime minister, convicted and currently fugitive.
A series of leaked clandestine recordings of political leaders in apparently compromising conversations further contributed to the negative tone.
In a development prior to the 2020 elections, the SDSM entered a pre-election coalition with BESA; the first time one of the two largest parties had made a pre-election pact with an ethnic-Albanian party.
The proposal by the DUI of an ethnic-Albanian candidate for prime minister caused heated exchanges.
The SDSM sharply criticised its former coalition partner, the DUI, linking that party with the former VMRO-DPMNE prime minister and claiming the party needed to go into opposition and reform its ranks.
The heightened rhetoric was reflected in an increased incidence of ethnically-based hate speech in social media, including against Albanian and Roma minorities.
On 18 June, the SEC organized the signing by election contestants of a code for fair and democratic elections.
On 29 June, the SEC president and the interior minister jointly called on electoral participants to comply with the law, warning of sanctions for pressuring, coercing or bribing voters.
The president and prime minister made public statements along similar lines.
The ODIHR SEAM noted isolated cases of ministers from different parties blurring their state functions and political activities, contrary to the OSCE commitments.
Claims were made by opposition parties of attempts to politically capitalize on social welfare programmes and aid distribution connected with the COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic distress.
These included a programme for distributing assistance to vulnerable people through credit cards for purchasing national products.
There were further claims that aid distribution during the state of emergency was presented as being linked with political parties.
No conclusive evidence of such misuse was presented to the ODIHR SEAM.
Political parties also reported to the ODIHR SEAM several cases of pressure on public officials, especially in the west of the country, including attempts to instrumentalize the police.
As in previous elections, the MISA established an online tool through which public employees could report instances of pressure.
Only two reports were filed, despite a number of allegations of pressure picked up by the media.
In the last days before the elections there were several allegations of vote-buying around the country, involving socially vulnerable people, often, but not exclusively, in Roma communities.
The ODIHR SEAM was informed that prosecutors had opened investigations in several cases.
In the days before the elections there was evidence of divisions within the MoI.
These reflected the arrangement in the caretaker government by which the interior minister was appointed by the opposition VMRODPMNE and an additional deputy minister was appointed by the SDSM, in addition to the regular deputy minister from the DUI.
In the days before the elections, the minister and additional deputy minister took opposing positions on vote buying allegations.
Several parties informed the ODIHR SEAM that these divisions continued on election day, as parties sought to engage the police on their behalf through their respective minister or deputy ministers.
Given the crucial role of police in ensuring a secure environment for elections, such politicisation of the police is particularly concerning.
Further efforts should be taken by the authorities to promptly counter any form of pressure on publicsector employees, including on police.
Public officials should be systematically informed about applicable mechanisms for reporting any instances of pressure for investigation and assured they will not face negative consequences; these mechanisms could be controlled by an independent body.
A greater prominence of women politicians was apparent at campaign events and on billboard posters; nevertheless, women were underrepresented in media coverage of the campaign.
Women constituted 42 per cent of registered candidates, yet ODIHR SEAM monitoring indicated that coverage of women politicians by media varied between only 4 and 14 per cent of candidate coverage.
Women candidates met by the ODIHR SEAM described a lack of support for prospective women leaders in internal party structures.
North Macedonia is an ethnically diverse country.
Parties traditionally competed for votes mainly within their respective ethnic communities, while governing coalitions have been formed across the ethnic divide, including ethnic-Albanian parties.
However, since the 2016 parliamentary elections, the SDSM has actively sought to draw support from ethnic-Albanian voters.
In addition to parties mainly representing ethnic Albanians, several parties represent smaller ethnic communities, most of which are aligned with either the SDSM or VMRO-DPMNE coalitions.
Representatives of these parties actively participated in the campaign, especially in places where their communities are concentrated.
In the 2020 elections, candidates from Roma communities also stood on the lists of the SDSM and VMRO-DPMNE as members of those parties, rather than as members of minority parties.
One such candidate told the ODIHR SEAM she believed that she would thus have more influence within the coalition.
The recently formed People’s Roma Party stood independently.
Some efforts were made in the campaign to address the needs of persons with disabilities, but were limited to a charitable approach, rather than promoting concepts such as universal design and socioeconomic empowerment.
When launching the SDSM campaign at a party convention on 9 March, the party leader promised that access to public buildings for persons with physical disabilities, via access ramps, would be mandatory by 2024, and that the financial allowance for persons with disabilities would be increased by 15 per cent.
Positively, videos of campaign events on social media sometimes included sign-language interpretation.
The SDSM programme was translated into sign language. Civil society organisations advocating the rights of persons with disabilities conducted training for political parties about how to address the needs of persons with disabilities, for example in making their websites more accessible.
The ODIHR SEAM was informed that only one person with a disability was a candidate in these elections, at an unlikely eligible position on the party list.
Election campaigns can be financed from monetary and in-kind donations from individuals and legal entities amounting up to EUR 3,000 and EUR 30,000 respectively, donations to parties, membership fees, and bank loans earmarked for election campaign.
Donations from foreign, municipal and anonymous sources, those from state-owned, religious, charitable organizations and the media are outlawed.
Campaign expenditure is limited to some MKD 110 (approx. EUR 2) per registered voter in a district (minimum EUR 490,830 in district 3 and maximum 544,930 in district 1).
The paid political advertisements in the broadcast, print and online media are funded directly by the state through a separate fund, which is administered by the SEC (see Media section).
Political parties that receive more than one per cent of votes are entitled to public funding.
Campaign finance received limited attention in the campaign narratives of contestants.
The unusual conditions for a campaign in the time of a pandemic also had an impact on campaign financing.
Electoral contestants informed the ODIHR SEAM that refraining from large-scale pre-election rallies brought a considerable saving, especially as it obviated the need to bus thousands of supporters to rally locations.
Nevertheless, the production costs of media advertisements and the heavy use of billboard posters represented significant expenditure.
Campaign finance is regulated by the Electoral Code, the Law on Financing of Political Parties, the Law on Prevention of Corruption and Conflict of Interests (LPCCI), and the Law on Accounting of Non-profit Organizations.
The legal framework on campaign financing requires further harmonization to eliminate gaps and inconsistencies and to provide legal certainty.
In particular, harmonization of the Electoral Code with the Law on Financing of Political Parties is necessary to unify the allowed value of donations for campaign purposes on campaign and party accounts.
The current amount of allowed donations to political parties exceeds the amount allowed for campaign purposes, which was utilized by some contestants to circumvent expenditure limits.
Amendments to the Electoral Code obliged compliance of the campaign reports with the Law on Accounting of Nonprofit Organizations, which does not provide for reporting on in-kind contributions, leading to a legal collision.
The Electoral Code maintains no longer applicable provisions on state compensation for campaign expenditures to contestants, which undermines legal certainty, especially in respect to the determination of sanctions for violating the rules on campaign finance reporting.
The law is silent about the use of loans for campaign purposes, as well as the determination of market price of donated goods, services and discounts, and contestants reported the amounts determined by agreements with service providers.
Moreover, there are no measures to ensure all campaign-related invoices are submitted before the deadline for the closure of campaign accounts.
The legal provisions regarding donations should be revised in order to harmonize donation limits, to provide transparency of and limits on loans received by political parties for election campaigning and to establish a mechanism to determine the market price of in-kind contributions.
The recent Electoral Code amendments provided for an additional interim report to be submitted 19 days after the election day and shortened the deadline for submission of the final report from four to three months after the elections; the period remains in considerable excess of the period recommended by international good practice.
Two interim reports are due before election day: one mid-campaign, and another one day prior to the elections, allowing no time for scrutiny or publication prior to the elections, contrary to previous ODIHR recommendations.
Only final reports are subject to obligatory audit.
The law does not detail the content of the reports, transferring the responsibility to address the lack of clarity and ensure adequate quality of the reports to the Ministry of Finance, which developed reporting templates.
The State Commission for Prevention of Corruption (SCPC) submits a report on campaign financing to the parliament three months after the elections, and hence cannot reflect the audit findings, which are to be delivered by the SAO within 60 days from the submission of the final report.
Unclear provisions on interim reporting triggered varying interpretations of their scope.
Most campaign participants assessed the interim reporting framework as burdensome, as three interim reports must be submitted in short intervals to three institutions (the SEC, SCPC, and the SAO).
The obligation for mid-term disclosure of donations was effectively respected by 9 of 15 contestants and the SEC did not consistently publish contestants’ interim reports, reducing transparency.
The second report on donations was submitted by 10 of 15 contestants, who reported primarily private donations and membership fees.
Most of the contestants intensified accumulation of funding in the second half of the campaign, and all of them relied on individual donations to party and campaign accounts.
Failure of some participants to use established reporting templates obscured the origin of funds transferred from political party accounts, undermining uniform disclosure.
Despite legal obligations, only some contestants published their reports on their websites.
The third interim reports were not published.
The Electoral Code should require that campaign finance reports be submitted and published on the day of submission in a uniform format suitable for public scrutiny and accompanied with supporting financial documentation.
Sanctions for late or non-submission should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
The deadline for submission of final reports should be readjusted to reflect international good practice.
In 2020, the Electoral Code was aligned with the LPCCI, shifting the primary jurisdiction over campaign finance oversight and abuse of administrative resources to the SCPC.
The SCPC is tasked to conduct ongoing monitoring of campaign financing throughout the electoral period, including financial activities of political parties and public officials, and to request data from banks and other competent institutions.
The body is entitled to initiate inspections ex officio and examine complaints by natural and legal persons, including by contestants, parties and election observers, and initiate criminal prosecution in case of violations and in reaction to the reports from the SAO.
The SAO exercises ex-post control of campaign finance based on auditing of the final report.
Pursuant to the Electoral Code amendments, banks are obliged to grant access to the transactions on campaign accounts to the SCPC and the SAO until the closure of the accounts.
However, the right to insight is not extended to regular party accounts, although their funds can be used for electoral campaign, and the provision of financial data after the closure of accounts is not foreseen, which would benefit from reconsideration to facilitate audit.
All stakeholders are obliged to provide financial documentations upon the request of the SAO, contributing to comprehensive evidencebased audit.
Although these amendments bring the campaign finance oversight closer in line with ODIHR and GRECO recommendations, further efforts should be made to improve transparency and accountability in political and campaign financing.
The agencies tasked with campaign oversight lack capacity due to insufficient financial and human resources, which undermined control over the accountability and transparency of campaign financing.
For these elections, the SCPC maintained communications with civil society for information on alleged violations.
Furthermore, the Commission strengthened its campaign oversight with the addition of 17 field monitors, provided with international assistance in the absence of adequate state funds, who collected evidence on campaign activities.
However, the findings of the monitors were not made public, missing an opportunity to increase transparency.
The State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption and the State Audit Office should be provided with adequate human and financial resources to effectively carry out their mandate during the electoral period.
The Electoral Code contains detailed provisions that provide for the equitable use of public spaces and prohibit the abuse of state resources.
From the announcement of elections, payments of salaries, pensions or welfare other than regular payments may not be made from budgetary funds.
Except in urgent cases, the public-sector employment of new persons or the termination of employment of existing employees is prohibited.
A recent amendment provides clarification as to what would constitute such urgent cases.
However, all these rules were suspended by government decree for the duration of the state of emergency.
A large number of media outlets, including 11 national and 36 regional private televisions, compete in a small advertisement market and lack financial, regulatory and professional sustainability, contributing to polarization of the media environment.
Government advertisements, which had served as the major source of income for many media outlets, are prohibited since 2017.
Ongoing stagnation in the advertising market caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has further increased the dependence of media on owners and state subsidies.
All ODIHR SEAM interlocutors assessed that significant improvements in media freedoms in recent years were not reinforced by systematic reforms in the media sector, such as ensuring the political neutrality of the public Macedonian Radio and Television (MRT) and the media regulator (the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services – AVMS).
The interlocutors highlighted the improved plurality of news coverage, but also noted a low level of professionalism, editorial focus on quantity of the content rather than its quality.
Furthermore, many interlocutors raised concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the deterioration of already challenging employment conditions for journalists.
Television remains the main source of information, followed by online media.
In April 2020, MRT increased the number of television channels from two to five, re-establishing MRT-2 as a 24-hour service in the Albanian language, as well as creating one channel that broadcasts in minority languages including Bosniac, Romani, Serbian, Turkish and Vlach.
Despite the introduction in 2018 of state subsidies for printing and distribution of national and regional newspapers, print media circulation has declined steadily.
The MRT is financed almost exclusively from the state budget since 2017, which, according ODIHR SEAM interlocutors, undermines its editorial independence.
The Programmatic Council oversees MRT’s content and appoints the Supervisory Board that is responsible for its financial oversight.
Both institutions are traditionally perceived as politically influenced, whereas their authority is limited as the mandates of their members expired.
In order to guarantee political independence, the public broadcaster should undergo a series of reforms, including changing the procedure for selection and appointment of the members of the Programmatic Council, and reducing its dependence on the state budget.
Further reforms of the public broadcaster should aim at improving the quality of content produced in-house, including investigatory and analytical journalism.
A number of ODIHR SEAM interlocutors raised their concern regarding dissemination of misleading or false information in online and social media.
To address this issue, several prominent professional media organizations created a register of professional online media outlets, which pledge to adhere to professional standards; the initiative enjoyed a limited traction.
The Electoral Code provides detailed regulation on the conduct of media from the announcement of elections through the campaign.
All broadcasters and websites covering the elections are required to do so in a fair, balanced and unbiased manner.
The proportional balance is to be based on the number of electoral districts the contestants is competing in, as well as the intensity of their campaign activities.
A February 2020 amendment to the Electoral Code required national broadcasters to supplement election coverage with sign language interpretation; all broadcasters monitored by the ODIHR SEAM failed to comply, which AVMS attributed to limited time to implement the provision.
The newscasts of the MRT during the campaign are subject to meticulous regulation on the amount of coverage dedicated to the ruling parties, the parliamentary opposition, and to lesser extent nonparliamentary parties and independent candidates.
As the law requires that an equal amount of time is dedicated to ruling and to opposition parties as groups rather than as individual parties, the combined coverage of the SDSM, the DUI and the DPA was to be identical to the combined news coverage of the opposition coalitions – the VMRO-DPMNE and the coalition of Alliance for Albanians (AfA) with AlternAtivA.
The public broadcaster complied with the obligations, although the MRT and other ODIHR SEAM interlocutors criticized the regulations as superfluous and undermining editorial independence.
Provisions regulating the public broadcaster’s newscasts during the campaign should be revised, with a view to provide for editorial freedom, pluralism of views and equal opportunities for contestants.
The Electoral Code mandates the MRT to allocate free time to the contestants between 16:00 and 23:00 hours.
Six parties decided to appear on MRT-1 and two parties on MRT-2.
On both channels, contestants’ free time was limited to speeches pre-recorded at the MRT premises, as self-produced footage was not allowed.
During the campaign period paid political advertisements in the private broadcast, print and online media are covered exclusively from the state budget.
The Electoral Code regulates the allocation of funds for paid political advertisements and establishes the time limits for such advertisements within each hour of broadcast.
However, this distribution formula for time and funds allocation was not envisaged by the regulatory framework.
On 22 June, the last day of the state of emergency, the Government amended the provisions on the allocation and distribution of funds and time limits for paid political advertising, including increasing the allowed amount of paid political advertisements per real hour.
Three contestants, the coalitions led by SDSM-BESA and the VMRO-DPMNE as well as the DUI, were at significant advantage, by being entitled to spend solely for the purposes of paid political advertisements some EUR 800,000 each, while the other twelve contestants were entitled to some EUR 30,000 each.
The existing overregulation together with the repeated changes of the legal framework created legal uncertainty, while disproportionate allocation of time and funds significantly limited the direct campaigning opportunities of twelve contestants, as they could not use any other funds to purchase paid political advertisements except those provided by the state.
Regulations on paid political advertisement in the media should be reconsidered, in order to allow unimpeded access to the media on a non-discriminatory basis.
All media outlets interested in selling space for paid political advertisements were required to register with the SEC.
In the absence of formal requirements and guidelines for registration of the media no verification of submitted information was performed.
Consequently, several broadcasters not licensed in North Macedonia received the registrations, which were subsequently revoked upon a notification by the media regulator.
In the absence of a clear definition of online media, some websites registered different language editions or different domains of the same webpage as separate media outlets, circumventing the legal limit on the amount for advertisement expenditures for one contestant in one print or online media (EUR 15,000).
Moreover, ODIHR SEAM interlocutors noted a high number of unknown new media outlets registering.
To ensure the transparency of media ownership and of campaign expenditures, online media interested in selling space for paid political advertisements should abide by some basic transparency requirements, including verifiable information on ownership and funding.
The February 2020 amendments to the Electoral Code stipulated that the maximum amount that any media could charge for political advertisements cannot exceed the average advertising rate used during previous five elections.
The maximum prices for all media were calculated by the SEC, the body responsible for disbursement of the state subsidies to the media outlets, on the basis of advertisement prices given by those media which offered their space the last five elections.
The provisions are disadvantageous to the broadcasters with highest audience, obliged to abide to the rates influenced by the average prices of smaller regional broadcasters and do not allow any adjustments due to the economic devaluations.
Five national televisions unsuccessfully challenged the SEC’s formula at the Administrative Court (see Complaints and Appeals).
Political advertisements in international online advertisement platforms like Google AdSense and in social media are not specifically regulated.
Whereas political parties used these campaign methods extensively, the lack of transparency of such tools renders any substantial audit impossible.
The compliance of broadcasters with the Electoral Code was overseen by the AVMS.
In the monitoring of the campaign coverage, the AVMS concluded that all private broadcasters had largely focused on the parliamentary parties, contrary to the requirements of the Electoral Code.
AVMS council sanctioned only TV Alsat-M and TV Shenja for failing to provide any coverage of nonparliamentary parties and systematic negative coverage of one of the participants, however it chose not to sanction TV Alfa that was also covering one of the contestants negatively.
The AVMS also initiated three misdemeanour procedures for the violation of the silence period; two resulted in fines and one was acquitted by the Administrative Court.
During the silence period, a number of political parties continued to advertise in online and social media, which were not actively monitored by any public institution.
The Agency also verified the presence of paid political advertisements in the broadcast media, subject to payment by the SEC.
The AVMS data for the monitoring of political advertisements indicated that several contestants spent over the legal limits.
At the end of September, the SEC informed the ODIHR SEAM that it had reimbursed the majority of media outlets, while the remaining few would need to rectify technical errors in their documentation in order to receive payments.
The Electoral Code does not provide any sanctions for electoral contestants which while signing contracts with the media, exceed the legal limits.
No verification or monitoring of online media was conducted.
In a number of cases the AVMS identified paid political advertisements featuring minors, contrary to the Electoral Code.
Although the responsibility for the advertisements’ content by law rests solely with the media outlets, the AVMS chose not to pursue sanctions but twice formally reminded broadcasters of the prohibition.
The media outlets raised concerns to ODIHR SEAM that within the current framework contestants have no direct motivation to avoid such violations.
Political parties, as producers of political advertisements, should be legally responsible for their content.
The ODIHR SEAM media monitoring of the official campaign period concluded that the newscasts of all national terrestrial broadcasters provided superficial coverage of the campaign activities, which was overshadowed by mutual accusations as well as by implications of the published recordings of political leaders.
In-depth analytical reporting or policy-based discussions were largely absent from the coverage of the campaign, limiting the opportunity for voters to make an informed choice between distinct policy alternatives.
Despite legal limitations that established exact quotas for coverage, both MRT-1 and MRT-2 displayed a visible effort to cover the activities of non-parliamentary political parties above the established 10 per cent quota.
However, the meticulousness of the legal requirements resulted in MRT-1 devoting to the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition slightly more coverage, some 18 per cent, compared to the SDSM, which had received 17 per cent of such coverage.
Other parliamentary parties, the DUI and the AfAAlternAtivA coalition received 15 and 13 per cent of the coverage accordingly.
The tone was largely neutral for all contestants.
The MRT-2 has also devoted some 19 per cent of the coverage to the VMRO-DPMNE, 18 per cent to the AfA-AlternAtivA coalition, 17 per cent to the SDSM and 15 per cent to the DUI.
Private media largely focused on the main political parties, and, to lesser extent, on smaller parliamentary parties, while visibility of the non-parliamentary parties was very low.
In their primetime newscasts two national private broadcasters, Sitel and Telma provided equal proportions, some 31 and 21 per cent, of mainly neutral coverage to the VMRO-DPMNE and the SDSM-led coalitions respectively.
A similar approach was noted during the first two weeks of the campaign on Kanal 5, however, in the final week of the campaign, its coverage of the SDSM-led coalition increased in comparison to that allotted to VMRO-DPMNE, though the tone remained mainly neutral for all contestants.
By contrast, Alfa strongly criticized the government and the ruling SDSM by allotting to them 28 and 40 per cent, respectively, of mainly negative and neutral coverage, while VMRO-DPMNE received 19 per cent of coverage, which was mainly neutral and positive in tone.
A similar trend was also observed on Alsat-M, which provided some 32 per cent of predominantly negative coverage to the DUI and some 15 per cent of mainly neutral and negative coverage to the VMRO-DPMNE led coalition, while the SDSM-led coalition received some 14 per cent of mainly neutral and positive coverage.
Numerous talk-shows and debates, including two debates between leaders of two largest political parties, the SDSM and the VMRO-DPMNE, were mainly used by the contestants as platforms for mutual personal criticism.
Nonetheless, while both public and private broadcaster displayed an effort to engage contestants in a debate, in a number of cases contestants chose not to participate due to the disagreement regarding selected debating partners, low ratings or perceived bias of the inviting broadcaster.
The Electoral Code provides for citizen, partisan and international observation.
On 19 February, the SEC adopted a Code of Conduct for Observers, binding for all accredited groups, amended on 2 July to increase transparency and freedom of movement for observers.
The SEC accredited 2,551 citizen and 102 international observers by the deadline.
Representatives of multiple civil society and citizen observer organizations, including civil society organization “MOST”, CIVIL Center for Freedom, and Inkluziva, observed key stages of the electoral process and its accessibility for persons with disabilities, contributing to the transparency of the process.
MOST also conducted a parallel vote tabulation (PVT), the results of which aligned closely with the turnout and results figures announced by the SEC.
Regulations on mechanisms for election dispute resolution are in place, but some prior ODIHR recommendations, including those related to limited standing and restrictive deadlines, remain unaddressed.
The majority of election-related complaints are within the jurisdiction of the SEC.
In the recent amendments to the Electoral Code, the MECs’ jurisdiction was clarified to encompass early voting and election day complaints by voters, restrictively interpreted by the SEC as only on voter registration.
Basic courts review allegations regarding electoral offences and complaints by contestants on interference with their campaign activities, while the SCPC deals with complaints related to campaign and political finance and misuse of administrative resources.
The Administrative Court is the final instance of appeal for the majority of complaints dealt with by the SEC and the SCPC, save for inadmissibility decisions, which cannot be challenged.
Positively, in 2020, its jurisdiction was extended to SEC decisions on campaign irregularities.
Voters have limited standing in electoral disputes, as they are entitled to complain about violations of their individual voting rights, which limits the possibility of legal redress, at odds with international commitments.
Electoral irregularities and election results can be contested by submitters of candidate lists.
Observers do not have the right to file complaints related to their observation, but, along with party representatives, can make entries in the logbooks maintained by EBs on observed irregularities, which can be contested at a later stage by list submitters.
Such entries are required for complaints to be recognized substantiated. The SEC is newly required to investigate alleged irregularities and violations before adopting a decision for complaints related to the protection of rights of list submitters.
The legal framework should be reviewed to eliminate undue restrictions on the right to lodge electoral complaints and appeals in order to provide for effective legal remedies.
The deadlines for electoral complaints are short.
As a rule, applicants have 24 to 48 hours to submit complaints, hampering due preparation.
Election day complaints are reviewed within four hours.
Positively, the 2020 amendments to the Electoral Code extended the complaints revision deadline by the SEC to 72 hours and readjusted those for filing complaints on violations during voting, counting and tabulation.
The courts decide on appeals in 48 or 60 hours.
Basic court has 24 hours to decide on electoral misdemeanour cases, which proved burdensome for the defendants and the judiciary, despite the limited number of cases.
There is no expedited procedure for investigation of electoral crimes, hampering effective prosecution and sanctioning of perpetrators.
Deadlines for the submission and resolution of complaints could be extended to allow adequate preparation and a reflected decision.
Consideration should be given to extending deadlines for examination of election-related misdemeanour cases, to comply with good practice.
Expedited procedures for investigation of electoral offenses should be provided.
Prior to the suspension of electoral process, the SEC reported having received few complaints, primarily related to the registration of voters residing abroad and the media.
In 6 of 15 complaints to the Administrative Court, media outlets unsuccessfully contested the SEC decision and guidelines on political advertising prices in broadcast media and on rejected registration applications of some media outlets into the Register that entitles the outlets to receive public funding (See Media Section).
Publications on the SEC website were unsuccessfully challenged at the Personal Data Protection Agency (PDPA), alleging disclosure of personal data.
Following the resumption of the process, the SEC rejected 42 complaints on early campaigning as unsubstantiated by evidence, without undertaking to examine them on merits.
The decisions were formalistic, identical in all cases, and lacked substantive reasoning, with formal decisions issued past the deadlines, which impeded effective legal remedy.
The SEC rejected 2,142 complaints by contestants, mostly as parties’ representatives did not invoke irregularities in PBs protocols, required as evidence.
The applicants alleged irregularities during voting and counting, discrepancies between the preliminary results announced by the SEC and the results in counting and tabulation protocols of election commissions, instances of voting on behalf of others, inclusion of deceased people in the voters list, and the validity of ballots.
Rules on the admissibility of complaints should establish reasonable requirements and the scope of admissible evidence should not be excessively limited.
Decisions and actions of the election administration should be reasoned, ensuring due guarantees for effective examination of the merits of complaints.
The transparency and efficiency of complaints resolution by the SEC were hampered as the online complaint submission system required by the Electoral Code was launched late in the process, despite prior ODIHR recommendations to address this issue.
The online complaint submission webpage included some 400 complaints, but the transparency of the process was affected as the webpage ceased functioning on election day.
To ensure efficient filing and handling of complaints, the online complaint submission system should be evaluated and redesigned.
For the first time, MECs had the legally defined competence to examine complaints about voting rights violations during early voting and on election day, and their decisions could be directly appealed to the Administrative Court.
Due to dual jurisdiction in the law, the SEC examined 21 cases previously decided by MECs, and in some instances reached an opposing decision.
The existence of parallel avenues for complaints resolution undermines legal certainty and contradicts international good practice.
The mechanism to protect voting rights on the election day does not allow for effective remedy due to the lack of training of the MECs, and primarily as MECs are not involved in voter registration and are unable to provide any genuine solution to the applicants.
The possibility of granting jurisdiction to an entity directly in charge of voter registration on the local level could be considered to avoid burdening the State Election Commission and to ensure the high volume of voter registration complaints on election day are effectively handled.
The SCPC established violations in two of six complaints alleging abuse of state resources, one of which was eventually overturned by the Administrative Court.
Prior to the elections, the Administrative Court rejected an appeal against a voter registration decision of a SEC regional office as unsubstantiated and recognized as unfounded an appeal against the SCPC decision on abuse of administrative resources.
The Administrative Court rejected all appeals against the SEC’s decisions on irregularities during counting and tabulation of results, recognizing the absence of protocol entries on irregularities valid also for rejecting challenges of discrepancies between the SEC-aggregated preliminary results with MECs and PBs protocols.
The COVID-19 pandemic affected the ability of the Administrative Court to hold public hearings and to form in a timely manner the judicial collegiums for election-related dispute resolution.
On 13 July, 67 special EBs conducted voting in 57 municipalities by visiting COVID-19 voters and those in self-isolation at their locations.
The special EBs comprised three healthcare workers and two political party representatives.
Members of special EBs were trained to follow specific protocols for protection against the infection and spread of COVID-19, which included the wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing, and disinfection at multiple stages in the process.
On 14 July, the SEC administered voting for all voters registered as ill or incapacitated, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and those in care facilities, prisons, and detention centres.
Regular EBs conducted mobile voting to service these voters at their locations, applying COVID-19 protection measures.
The early voting period generally proceeded in an orderly manner and without major incidents or tension.
The ballots cast on both days of early voting were added to the ballot boxes of the polling stations of the voters’ registered precincts and were counted at the end of general voting on 15 July.
On 15 July, members of the ODIHR SEAM visited a limited number of polling stations to observe the voting and counting procedures.
The voting was generally well administered, with EBs displaying sound knowledge of voting procedures.
Some cases were noted of voters with new IDs not being included in voter lists.
Minor operational issues were reported by the election administration.
Both the election administration and voters largely respected the health protocols, but some visited premises were not sufficiently spacious to allow for the recommended distance between persons.
As the number of voters allowed into a polling station equalled the number of booths, the queues that ensued resulted in crowds in common spaces, particularly where several polling stations were located in the same premises.
The majority of visited polling stations could not be independently accessed by persons with physical disabilities.
The Braille covers for ballots were available for visually impaired voters, but an NGO working on the issues related to people with disabilities – Inkluziva – informed the ODIHR SEAM that only some two per cent of visually impaired are Braille literate.
In line with international obligations, practical measures should further strive to ensure full access of persons with disabilities to the voting process.
The ODIHR SEAM received allegations of vote-buying in different regions of the country, both in the days before and on election day, especially among the Roma community.
The SEAM also received reports of tension, instances of pressure on voters around polling stations, and alleged ballot stuffing, notably in locations in the Kichevo and Saraj municipalities, as well as a reported violent incident in Zajas.
On 23 July, the MoI filed before the Prosecutor’s Office for Organized Crime and Corruption a criminal charge against an adviser to caretaker Minister of Interior, for alleged threatening and offending of Tetovo Internal Affairs Sector Chief on election day.
Media reported police arrests for alleged ballot stuffing in the Saraj municipality.
The SEC introduced the web-based application “uVote” in these elections for the electronic transmission of interval turnout data as well as of preliminary results.
The application offered the possibility for voters to view the entered data on partial turnout and preliminary results.
On 25 February, after the initial announcement of the elections, the SEC launched a public tender for procuring new software and upgrading existing software related to the transmission of election results, which provided specifications of the required service.
The State Appeals Commission for Public Procurement (SACPP), following a competitor’s appeal, found that elements of the specification jeopardized a genuine competition.
The SEC subsequently lowered the required criteria.
Following a new procurement procedure, on 29 June the local IT company DUNA was awarded the contract for development of the web-based application for transmission of turnout and final results – uVote.
In the process of developing uVote, no large-scale simulations of the application were conducted, and the SEC’s supervision over DUNA’s application was limited.
The SEC informed the ODIHR SEAM that an operability test was conducted two days ahead of elections, but that no report on its results was presented to the SEC prior to election day.
The election administration received no training on the use of the application beyond written instructions.
The reporting of turnout data throughout the day was affected by temporary technical problems, and the MECs at times resorted to collecting this data via phone calls and text messages.
Shortly after the closing of polling stations and the first entries of preliminary results, the web application stopped displaying these preliminary data; this disruption was highly publicized in the media on election night.
The SEC president reported a cyber-attack, which, according to the SEC, affected the publication of results, without affecting the process of results count and tabulation.
The SEC adjusted by live-streaming the information from its turnout and results database on YouTube.
DUNA stated that their responsibility covered the performance of the application, but not the security of the server that was attacked, the maintenance of which relies upon the SEC.
The SEC IT informed the ODIHR SEAM that an attack to its main website was successfully addressed and the problems in delivering the results should be sought in the application itself.
According to several SEAM interlocutors who were involved, such technical challenges may have been caused by a combination of external attack(s) and insufficient IT capability in the SEC.
The technical breakdowns raised doubts, including among political parties and other stakeholders, regarding the announced results.
The SEC undertook a cross check of the hardcopies of the EB final protocols from all polling stations against the results electronically uploaded into the database.
The ODIHR SEAM observed the verification being done in an organized and professional manner.
Ultimately, the SEC officially announced the preliminary results with some 20-hour delay, at 19:30 hours on 16 July.
On 18 July, the SEC issued a correction of the results due to earlier technical errors; although the correction was minor, it added to the public speculation about the integrity of the results.
To ensure the integrity of the electoral process, a comprehensive cyber-strategy should be developed and implemented by the State Election Commission.
The strategy should include vulnerability assessments and mitigation tactics, including related to institutional capacity, adequate software and hardware, security measures, and a fully trained and permanent IT staff within the election administration.
On 22 July, a group calling itself “AnonOpsMKD” claimed responsibility for the cyber-attack, denying the SEC was its target.
On 28 July, the Prosecutor’s Office for Organized Crime entered the SEC to investigate possible crime in the procurement procedure of software solutions.
The PDPA initiated ex officio extraordinary supervision in the SEC, and determined breaches of the personal data protection regulations.
On 25 July the SEC announced the final results and handed over the certificates to the elected MPs.
Women constituted 36 per cent of the elected deputies (43 of 120 MPs, 4 less compared to the previous legislature).
The SEC reported 3.34 per cent of cast ballots being invalid.
The SEC attributes this relatively high figure to the intentional spoiling of ballots by voters in protest, rather than a lack of understanding on how to mark a ballot.
The Electoral Code requires a voter to mark its choice by circling the number of the list submitter, but also recognizes the vote as valid if the choice can be determined in a reliable and unambiguous manner.
The SEC issued instructions that exemplified the interpretation of the law on the validity of ballot.
The SEC told the ODIHR SEAM that it attempted to collect gender-disaggregated of those who voted but that the information received from MECs and EBs was incomplete.
These recommendations, as contained throughout the text, are offered with a view to enhance the conduct of elections in the Republic of North Macedonia and to support efforts to bring them fully in line with OSCE commitments and other international obligations and standards for democratic elections.
These recommendations should be read in conjunction with prior ODIHR recommendations that remain to be addressed.
ODIHR stands ready to assist the authorities of North Macedonia to further improve electoral processes and to address the recommendations contained in this and previous reports.
The Electoral Code should be comprehensively reviewed in order to harmonize it internally and with other relevant laws, to bring it in line with OSCE commitments, international obligations and good practice.
The revision should be done in a public procedure, after a broadly inclusive consultation process and sufficiently in advance of the next elections in order to guarantee legal certainty.
To ensure the stability and professionalism of the election administration, the tenure of the State Election Commissioners’ mandate should be clearly stipulated by the Electoral Code.
The Code should also provide for a clear and transparent procedure of nomination and appointment of electoral commissioners.
In order to ensure a comprehensive regulatory framework, the Election Code should be revised to clarify and consolidate permanent detailed instructions on voter registration procedures.
Requirements in the Code should correspond to the functionality of the central population register.
The State Commission for the Prevention of Corruption and the State Audit Office should be provided with adequate human and financial resources to effectively carry out their mandate during the electoral period.
Regulations on paid political advertisement in the media should be reconsidered, in order to allow unimpeded access to the media on a non-discriminatory basis.
In order to guarantee political independence, the public broadcaster should undergo a series of reforms, including changing the procedure for selection and appointment of the members of the Programmatic Council, and reducing its dependence on the state budget.
Further reforms of the public broadcaster should aim at improving the quality of content produced in-house, including investigatory and analytical journalism.
The legal framework should be reviewed to eliminate undue restrictions on the right to lodge electoral complaints and appeals in order to provide for effective legal remedies.
To ensure equality of the vote, legislation should foresee periodic review of district boundaries by an independent body.
When district boundaries are redefined, it should be done in a timely, transparent, impartial and inclusive manner under a clear and consistent methodology.
Essential personnel should be employed in the State Election Commission’s secretariat on a permanent basis.
The capacity of the secretariat’s human resources should match the powers vested to the Commission pursuant to the Electoral Code.
If retained as a tool for the selection of election commission members, the Ministry of Information Society and Administration should update its database of public employees, engaging the respective institutions.
The authorities could consider revising the pool of state bodies from which public employees are called to serve on election commissions.
In order to ensure the integrity of the electoral process, a comprehensive cyber-strategy should be developed and implemented by the SEC.
It should include institutional capacity, adequate software and hardware, security measures, and a fully trained and permanent IT staff within the election administration.
The legal framework should be harmonized with international standards related to the right to vote of persons with intellectual and psycho-social disabilities.
In line with previous ODIHR recommendations, more attention should be paid to the harmonization of data supplied to the voter register, namely the interoperability of received data and standardization of the address system.
Quality audits of the register should be undertaken and made public on a regular basis.
To facilitate the exercise of voting rights, additional measures could be considered to enfranchise first time voters without ID cards, citizens whose IDs expire shortly before the call for elections and citizens who do not collect a new ID before the voter list is updated by the State Election Commission.
Limitations on the right to stand as a candidate should be reviewed to ensure that disqualification based on a conviction is proportionate to the gravity of the offence.
Consideration should be given to aligning the official campaign period with the timeline for registration of contestants, to ensure campaign regulations apply consistently to all.
Regular political activities before the official campaign period should not be prohibited and should be regulated.
Further efforts should be taken by the authorities to counter any form of pressure on public-sector employees, including on police.
Public officials should be systematically informed about applicable mechanisms for reporting any instances of pressure and assured they will not face negative consequences; the cases should be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted.
Legal provisions regarding donations should be revised in order to harmonize donation limits, to provide transparency of and limits on loans received by political parties for election campaigning, and to establish a mechanism to determine the market price of in-kind contributions.
The Electoral Code should require campaign finance reports be submitted and published on the day of submission in a uniform format suitable for public scrutiny and accompanied with supporting financial documentation.
Sanctions for late or non-submission should be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.
The deadline for the submission of final reports should be readjusted to reflect international good practice.
The regulation on closing the campaign account should ensure completion of financial operations.
The deadline for the submission of final reports should be readjusted to reflect international good practice.
