All OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors stated that this process proved operationally complex and methodologically challenging, as well as requiring major financial and human resources.
At the start of the process, the SEC searched for inconsistencies in the databases and analysed records that could indicate possible irregularities, such as deceased persons on the lists, large number of voters registered at the same address or voters with similar names and dates of birth.
Out of approximately 1.8 million voters, over 300,000 voters were identified as needing clarification of their  status.
Some  220,000  records  of  voters  were  forwarded  for  verification  to  several  state institutions.
As a result of data crosschecking, the SEC published a list of 89,000 citizens whose registration records were to be confirmed during field visits at voters’ residence.
Between 28 March and 5 April, over 550 SEC representatives visited the households of some 87,000 voters and filled out questionnaires.
The field checks confirmed 47,560 records (the voters concerned were met in person) and 39,792 records were forwarded for additional administrative checks to the MoIA and the Ministry of Justice.
Subsequently, nearly all of those records were established to be accurate.
While the SEC made significant efforts to conduct the field verification, which was also aimed to increase public confidence, alleged irregularities, such as fictitious voters and other fraudulent practices, were still being used as one of the main arguments for the postponement of the elections.
The supporters of this idea criticized the process for being chaotic, methodologically unsound and at times inadequately addressing prior allegations of fraud.
Between March and May 2016, the SEC submitted to the MoIA 45 written requests for data verification.
Many of the MoIA responses were signed only by the deputy minister, as the minister, representing SDSM, refused to do so arguing that more time was needed to conduct accurate checks.
The SDSM representatives in the SEC questioned the legality of such documents, but the SEC decided to accept them.
The interior minister also requested the SEC to remove some 130,000 voters who possess a passport but not a valid identification document to prove the residence.
The SEC rejected this request on the ground that law provides for registration of voters with either a valid identification card or a passport.
One of the most important SEC requests to the MoIA pertained to 73,000 voters identified by SEC as requiring confirmation of their residence status.
While MoIA formally confirmed the legality of these records, many OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors questioned whether this verification was done scrupulously.
One of the main examples of concerns about registration irregularities was the so called “Pustec voters” – the citizens living in the Republic of Albania whose voter eligibility was in question because of unclear residency status.
These persons were allegedly added to the voter lists in Skopje Centar municipality to influence the outcome of local elections.
According to the MoIA, in January 2016 a total of 349 identification cards of these persons were cancelled for not having the right to register residence at specific addresses.
Allegations  of  fictitious  records  in  the  voter  register  persisted,  as  many  OSCE/ODIHR  EOM stakeholders claimed that the total number of voters was suspiciously high based on the number of citizens as per the 2002 census.
Inaccuracy in the voter lists was also used by many OSCE/ODIHR interlocutors as an argument for postponing elections.
Addressing these allegations, and upon a SEC request, the MoIA announced that as of 31 March there were 2,464,925 citizens in the population register, including 1,956,518 over 18 years and some 150,000 without residence or valid identification document.
In addition, the last progress report on updating voter lists issued by the SEC on 26 April did not reveal evidence of voter registration fraud.
Almost all of the 300,000 records initially identified by SEC as questionable were validated.
Minor changes were made, mainly by removing over 1,100 deceased persons identified during electronic data crosschecks.
PUBLIC INSPECTION OF THE VOTER LISTS
The public inspection of preliminary voter lists for the 5 June elections was conducted between 25 April and 9 May  at SEC’s 34 regional and local offices.
Voters could check their own data electronically but not the data of other citizens as required by the Electoral Code.
The system of public verification was more cumbersome for those without access to internet and those who live in rural areas.
The inspection process was not implemented uniformly across the country – while in some offices voters could check their data by their personal identification number, in others this was possible also by name, address and polling station number.
Only 4,716 voters verified the accuracy of their data.
As of 17 May, there were 1,804,348 registered voters on the voter lists.
The SEC had to remove on 30 March the voter lists from the website due to a decision of the Directorate for Personal Data Protection prohibiting the publication of personal data of voters including name, gender, address, date of birth and polling station number.
The lack of possibility for voters to  check the voter lists during this time impacted the transparency  and the public confidence in the quality of voter lists.
To increase public confidence and provide easier access of voters to verify voter lists, consideration could be given to displaying printed excerpts  of voter lists at locations convenient to voters, possibly at polling stations.
The  OSCE/ODIHR EOM was  informed  about  a  number  of  examples  of  alleged  existence  of fictitious voters (so called “phantom voters”) and other irregularities.
The EOM followed up on a randomly selected sample of such irregularities; while many of the checked allegations proved to be false or pertained to registration errors which had already been corrected, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM confirmed  instances  of  voters  registered at non-existing addresses,  which can indicate  either registration malpractice or administrative errors.
On 14 May, the SEC shared the voter lists with the four largest political parties who had five days to request any changes.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM is not informed of any requests made by political parties by the 22 May deadline.
On 26 May, the SEC published the entire voter list on its website, ensuring broad public access to registration  data  as  the  lists  could  be  checked  by  personal  identification  number,  names  and addresses.
Voters  could  apply  for  any  changes  in  person  at  the  local  offices  of  SEC.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM is not informed of any challenges made by voters or other stakeholders.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM noted the ongoing discussion on replacing the existing passive voter registration  system  with  an  active  registration  system  as  a  means  to  prevent  the  alleged irregularities.
Some OSCE/ODIHR interlocutors, however, argued that active registration is costly, time consuming and likely to disenfranchise voters unable to visit registration centers for personal reasons, such as disability or living abroad.
The  current  system  of  voter  registration  based  on  personal  identification  number  can  ensure accuracy of voter lists and provide sufficient safeguards against fraud and double registration if implemented consistently and correctly.
While the MoIA is responsible for the accuracy of records, it is also critical that citizens inform the relevant authorities of any changes in their personal data and residency in a timely matter, as required by the law.
The SEC and MoIA should continue the process of updating of voter register though a co-ordinated effort according to clear responsibilities and procedures.
Adequate resources and time should be allocated to accomplish this task before the next elections.
This process should be transparent and ensure  access  to  political  parties  and  civil  society.
It  should  be  accompanied  by  a  public information  campaign  in  order  to  increase  the  citizens’ confidence  in  the  accuracy  of  voter registration.
CANDIDATE REGISTRATION
Any eligible voter can be a candidate for parliament, except those who have been sentenced by a final court decision to more than six months imprisonment and have not completed their sentence.
The  law  also  identifies  a  range  of  government  and  government-related  positions  that  are  incompatible with candidacy.
In addition, MPs cannot work in state administration bodies or engage in business or other profitable activity.
Candidates can be nominated by political parties, coalitions of political parties, or by groups of voters.
Lists  submitted  by  groups  of  voters  are  required  to  provide  at  least  1,000  supporting signatures of voters residing in the  respective  district.
In line with a  previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendation, a voter could sign in support of more than one prospective contestant.
However, contrary to a prior OSCE/ODIHR recommendation, signatures must still be collected in front of a regional  SEC  representative.
According  to  several  OSCE/ODIHR  EOM  interlocutors,  the requirement to visit a SEC office may have a dissuasive or intimidating effect on some voters, especially in smaller communities.
As previously recommended, consideration could be given to providing alternative methods for signature collection in order to reduce the potential for intimidation.
By the 11 May deadline, the SEC received three candidate lists.
Of the four major parliamentary parties, only the VMRO-DPMNE coalition submitted lists.
The lists respected the new Electoral Code provision requiring that at least 40 percent of candidates must belong to the less represented gender.
Two non-parliamentary parties, the National Movement for Macedonia (NMM) and the Social Democratic Party of Macedonia (SDP), also nominated candidates.
No independent lists were submitted.
The SEC accepted the VMRO-DPMNE lists on 12 May and returned the other two parties lists for correction of deficiencies.
On 15 May, the SDP withdrew its lists and the SEC rejected the NMM lists for failure to correct the identified deficiencies.
To avoid any confusion and the rejection of candidate list for technical reasons, all specific documents required for each list could be enumerated in the Electoral Code.
The candidate registration process concluded with only one registered contestant, a situation which the Electoral Code does not specifically regulate.
A review of the Electoral Code could consider including provisions to regulate the situation where only one electoral contestant is running for parliamentary elections.
CAMPAIGN FINANCE
The Electoral Code regulates the financing of election campaigns.
All campaign-related donations and expenditures must go through a dedicated bank account.
Eligible private persons are allowed to donate up to the equivalent of EUR 3,000 in MKD, while legal entities may donate up to an equivalent of EUR 30,000.
Foreign or anonymous donations, as well as those from state-owned,  religious and charitable organizations, are prohibited.
Discounts given by media outlets to campaign participants for political advertisements are considered donations and are prohibited.
An electoral contestant may not spend more than an equivalent of EUR 1.8 per registered voter in a given electoral district.
Electoral contestants have to submit two interim and a final campaign finance reports to the SEC, State Commission for Preventing Corruption (SCPC) and the State Audit Office (SAO).
In line with previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, itemized reporting on campaign finance expenditure is now required and the SAO has been given the explicit authority to request additional explanations from contestants during the audit process.
As the elections were cancelled just two days after the campaign began, no campaign finance reports were filed.
The SAO is obligated to audit the final campaign finance reports within 60 days of submission.
If irregularities are detected the SAO initiates a misdemeanour procedure or reports the irregularities to the respective public prosecutor within 30 days of detection.
The SAO has the right to request additional explanations and data from electoral contestants.
The SAO stated to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that they were not properly resourced for carrying out supervision of campaign finance reports as they  are auditors and not investigators.
Further, they do not possess the necessary personnel to carry out monitoring of campaign finance spending in order to determine if there are irregularities.
Monitoring  and  supervision  of  campaign  finance  provisions  should  be  carried  out  by  an independent agency  that  has  the  necessary  personnel  and  expertise  to  effectively  monitor  for irregularities.
Should that be the SAO, they should be provided with the adequate powers and resources.
MEDIA
MEDIA ENVIRONMENT
The media environment is divided along ethnic lines and is characterized by a high number of media  outlets  operating  in  a  limited  advertising  market.
A  number  of  OSCE/ODIHR  EOM interlocutors raised concerns regarding the deterioration of media freedom due to political pressure and owners interfering in the work of journalists.
The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media (RFoM) called on the authorities “to ease the pressure on media and respect free and critical voices”.
The  public  broadcaster,  Macedonian  Radio  and  Television  (MRT),  operates  three  channels nationally and is funded through a broadcast tax imposed on households and legal entities.
It is also entitled to seek and receive additional funds from the state budget.
The majority of the private broadcasters that the OSCE/ODIHR EOM met with reported minimal or no profit, and rely on the support from their owners as well as government-funded advertisements.
A number of OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors opined that the government choice of broadcasters  for  advertising  is  perceived  as  a  reward  for  favourable  coverage  and  editorial  policy.
This contradicts a recommendation made by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), which requires state institutions to treat all media that receive direct and indirect subsidies fairly and with neutrality.
In addition, the law prohibits political parties and office holders at state institutions, as well as their family members to own broadcasters.
The  allocation  of  state  advertisements  should  be  done  in  a  transparent,  objective  and  non-discriminatory manner, including by providing detailed information on the substance and funds for such advertisements.
LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR THE MEDIA
Coverage of the elections by media outlets is governed by the Electoral Code and the 2013 Law on Audio  and  Audiovisual  Media  Services.
The  legal  framework  for  coverage  of  elections  was substantially amended in November 2015.
It now provides detailed requirements for paid political advertisements and prohibits broadcasters and their owners to donate funds to the contestants; shortens deadlines for media-related complaints and misdemeanours procedures and increases fines for violations; prohibits the coverage of state officials that favours a political party; allows non-parliamentary parties to receive free airtime on the Parliamentary Channel and obliges MRT to host regular election debates.
The amendments also include requirements for campaign coverage by Internet portals.
Despite these amendments, the majority of OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors highlighted  a  need  for  continued  substantial  reform.
As  part  of  the  Przino  Agreement, consultations between the four political parties and civil society organizations were held to further reform  the  media  landscape,  however,  the  parties  have  failed  to  reach  a  consensus  while amendments coming from civil society organizations were dismissed by the parliament on 4 April.
The Electoral Code prohibits coverage of the regular activities of state institutions that promote political  parties  and  coalitions.
It  also  details  the  coverage  requirements  during  the  official campaign period, at times in an over-regulated manner.
The Electoral Code obliges the MRT, as well other broadcast and Internet media to cover the elections in a fair, balanced and unbiased manner providing contestants with equitable access.
By law, the balance is established on the number of candidate lists, which are officially confirmed only few days before the start of the official campaign period.
As such, a balanced coverage is not enforceable during the pre-campaign period.
In January 2016, the MRT adopted Ethical and Professional Principles of MRT for Media Coverage of  the  Election  Process,  establishing  the  general  guidelines  for  their  journalists  to  cover  the elections.
In addition, the Electoral Code provides very detailed and exact requirements for the  coverage of the campaign which results in excessive coverage of the  campaigns of the main political parties.
This may also challenge MRT’s editorial independence.
The Electoral Code also outlines detailed requirements for paid political advertisements, allowing 18 minutes per hour in total.
As the law also allows 12 minutes per hour of broadcast for commercial advertisements, a number of OSCE/ODIHR interlocutors were of the opinion that 30 minutes of advertisement per hour of broadcast is excessive.
The prices for the advertisements could not exceed the average commercial prices during the three months prior to the announcement of the elections; however, the Code does not envisage any verification of the media fulfilling this requirement.
The Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services (AVMS) is the key regulator for the broadcast media.
It is legally required to monitor broadcasters and their websites from the day of the announcement of elections until the day of voting, publish weekly reports before the campaign, and publish daily reports during the campaign.
The agency has no legal power to impose sanctions directly, but can bring the identified violation to the court’s attention.
AVMS monitored only national broadcasters during the pre-campaign period.
It did not monitor Internet media stating that there was lack of a clear definition of Internet portals in the legislation, which did not allow them to establish a clear monitoring sample.
AVMS released three interim and one final reports covering the pre-campaign period.
The reports concluded that private broadcasters Alfa, Kanal 5, Kanal 5+, Sitel and Nova failed to provide objective and unbiased coverage as prescribed by the law.
The reports also concluded that the first four media listed above co-ordinated their editorial policy.
The agency took no action based on the biased coverage, while the Electoral Code sanctions such violations, no sanctions are provided by the Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Services.
The Electoral Code could be amended to clarify the requirements for balanced reporting during the pre-campaign period.
Consideration could be given to provide AVMS with greater resources to undertake  its  oversight  role  and  sanctioning  powers  that  are  effective,  proportionate  and dissuasive.
On 13 May the AVMS forwarded to the court an initiative for a misdemeanour procedure against Alfa, Kanal 5 and Sitel for a number of reports covering activities of state institutions that were promoting  VMRO-DPMNE.
Despite  the  48-hours  legal  requirement,  the  court  did  not  issue  decision at the time of this reporting.
The AVMS also identified violations in the third monitoring period, but it did not initiate any sanctions after the elections were cancelled.
The Council of Media Ethics (CME) is a self–regulatory body that reviews complaints about media content.
On 12 February, the members of the Council signed the Charter on Ethical Reporting during Elections, pledging to report in a balanced, truthful, impartial and objective manner.
The CME did not perform any monitoring of the media nor had performed any other activities related to elections during the electoral period.
MEDIA MONITORING FINDINGS
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM conducted media monitoring of major broadcast and print media outlets during the pre-campaign period and the two days of election campaign.
The newscasts of the public MRT-1 provided limited information about political events and avoided comprehensive reporting in their daily news coverage.
The coverage of the relevant political actors was mainly factual and neutral and was largely devoted to government activities (30 per cent), VMRO-DPMNE (18 per cent) and SDSM (15 per cent).
All other political parties received marginal coverage.
In several cases, MRT-1 journalists mixed facts with their own political opinions when covering the news.
The Albanian language service of MRT-2 devoted more attention, proportionally, to the ethnic-Albanian parties, especially to DUI, which received 13 per cent of mainly neutral coverage, while SDSM and VMRO-DPMNE received each 12 per cent of same type of coverage.
Numerous talk shows served as a platform for political parties to present their views, however, there was a lack of genuine policy debate among the two major political forces – VMRO-DPMNE and SDSM.
The Electoral Code requires the public broadcaster to organize debates between the ruling and opposition parties during the campaign period.
MRT-1 attempted to organize two debates between  VMRO-DPMNE,  SDSM,  DUI  and  DPA;  however  only  VMRO-DPMNE  chose  to participate and only once.
While Telma, Vesti 24 and Alsat-M were hosting regular debates and talk shows, they stated to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that VMRO-DPMNE ignored their invitations.
The most popular private TV stations, Sitel and Kanal 5, together with Alfa, displayed a unified approach in the news coverage.
They allocated between 24 and 26 per cent of politically relevant news coverage to the activities of VMRO-DPMNE, between 21 and 27 per cent to SDSM and about 6 per cent to all other parties combined.
The tone of the coverage was almost exclusively positive and neutral towards VMRO-DPMNE, their high-level government members, as well as the counter-demonstrations organized by GDOM.
At times, the coverage of governmental activities was linked with the promotion of VMRO-DPMNE’s future policies, which is contrary to the Electoral Code.
The coverage of SDSM and of the ministers representing the party, the Special Prosecutor Office and the demonstrations organized by Protestiram was mainly  negative in tone.
The  coverage included selective presentation of the facts and opinions voiced by the journalists, many times using identical sentences on all three broadcasters.
To guarantee equitable coverage and access for all political contestants, the broadcast media should ensure balance in their news and current affairs reporting in the pre-campaign period, as required by the law.
Telma and cable-only Vesti 24 provided more balanced and in-depth coverage of the news.
Both stations devoted equitable proportions of largely neutral coverage to VMRO-DPMNE (17 and 15 per cent) and SDSM (15 and 12 per cent).
Alsat-M¸ which mainly broadcasts in Albanian language also devoted equitable proportions (between 10 and 12 per cent) of coverage to VMRO-DPMNE, SDSM and DUI, although it was largely critical of VMRO-DPMNE and neutral to other parties.
The political coverage in the print media was more polarized than broadcast media.
While Dnevnik was  clearly  biased  against  SDSM,  the  majority  of  the  political  coverage  by  Sloboden  Pecat presented VMRO-DPMNE and the government in a negative manner.
The tabloid Vest provided very  limited  political  coverage,  but  was  leaning  towards  VMRO-DPMNE.
Albanian  language newspapers Koha and Lajm were more focused on the activities of the ethnic-Albanian parties.
While Koha mainly focused on the activities and projects of DUI, Lajm was largely criticizing DUI and their members of the government.
CITIZEN AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS
The Electoral Code provides for international and citizen election observation.
The citizen observer organization MOST engaged in a comprehensive monitoring of the electoral process with 80 long-term observers.
The CIVIL organization had 35 long-term observers.
On 4 May MOST filed the application for the accreditation of 27 observers to the SEC; the SEC did not grant accreditation to them before the elections were cancelled on 18 May, however, this did not hinder their observation activities.
Both CIVIL and MOST were critical of the electoral process, particularly in respect of a non-transparent field review of voter lists, misuse of state resources for party purposes, and pressure upon public administration employees.
MOST and CIVIL claimed that the government failed to provide conditions for holding credible elections.
COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
Election-related complaints can be filed by authorized representatives of candidates, submitters of candidates’ lists, and voters.
The complaints are heard by the SEC, and its decisions can be appealed to the Administrative Court, which makes a final judgment.
The MECs do not have jurisdiction over electoral complaints.
In response to prior OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, the 2015 amendments to the Electoral Code shortened the deadlines for hearing and deciding on electoral complaints and require the SCPC to examine cases at a public session.
Decisions on complaints should be published on their websites.
Despite  the  constitutional  requirement  for  all  court  hearings  and  verdicts  to  be  public,  the Administrative Court operated in a non-transparent manner, and reviewed the two election-related cases without a public hearing.
The court informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that the judges would decide the cases in private.
The lack of guaranteed public hearings by the Administrative Court is contrary to OSCE commitments and other international standards, reducing public confidence in the process.
The Electoral Code should be harmonized with the Constitution and state clearly that all hearings on election related cases should be held in public and that decisions are made public immediately.
Of the two cases, the first one related to publishing voter lists on the SEC website.
The Directorate for Personal Data Protection issued a decision on 29 March ordering the SEC to remove the voter lists from its website as this violated the law on personal data protection.
On 9 April, the SEC appealed the decision to the Administrative Court.
Although the case was time sensitive, the court did not make a decision until 5 May and did not publish the decision until 16 May, after the deadline for public inspection of the voter lists had passed.
Due to the delay, the voters did not have the possibility to check the voter lists for irregularities as provided for in the Electoral Code.
To ensure effective remedy, all election-related cases should be decided within timely deadlines clearly stated in the law.
The second case concerned the appeal of the SEC decision rejecting the candidate list on procedural grounds submitted by the NMM.
On 17 May, the court found that in order to check the eligibility of a candidate, it was legitimate for the SEC to request copies of identification documents and criminal records.
In contrast to the Administrative Court, the Constitutional Court held public sessions when hearing the petition on the unconstitutionality of the dissolution of parliament and published its decision on the day the hearing was held.
In line with previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, the SEC established a legal department for handling complaints.
However, the SEC did not adopt an instruction for deciding on complaints and appeals, as required by the Electoral Code.
The lack of permanent guidelines on the complaints and appeals process inhibits the ability of electoral stakeholders to submit complaints, and undermines the effectives of the means of legal redress, as required by paragraph 5.10 of the 1990 OSCE Copenhagen Document.
In addition, the Electoral Code calls for the establishment of a system for case and complaint management that was not operational for these elections.
To allow effective legal remedy, the SEC should develop permanent instructions on complaints and appeals  process.
Such  regulations  could  be  harmonized  with  the  new  complaint  management system.
Telephone  hotlines  were  established  by  several  state  institutions:  the  Ministry  of  Information Society and Administration for public sector employees to report any election-related pressure; the Ombudsman  Office  for  citizens  to  report  violations  of  their  electoral  rights;  and  the  Public Prosecutor’s Office for citizens and civil society organizations to report any suspicion of criminal activity related to the elections.
According to these institutions, very few calls were received and none concerned serious violations.
The Public Prosecutor received 28 reports or complaints of which 14 were referred to the relevant basic public prosecutor’s office with instructions to act urgently and report back.
No grounds of suspicion of criminal activity were found in the remaining allegations.
The public prosecutor informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that it will keep the hotline open for reports of electoral irregularities and will continue to investigate cases that were already reported.
PARTICIPATION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES
Inter-ethnic relations remain a relevant factor in the politics of the country and political parties tend to mainly reach out to their own communities.
Inter-ethnic issues did not, however, feature prominently in the on-going political crisis, and relations among communities were not the focus of political confrontation.
Smaller communities expressed concern to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM about not being involved in international and domestic efforts to find a way out of the political crisis.
They also claimed that parties representing larger communities use administrative resources and public employment to ensure support from minorities.
Parties representing smaller communities also complained about lack of access to media.
Parties  representing  the  ethnic-Albanian  community,  and  particularly  DUI,  were  decisive  in initiating and finalising the process which led to 5 June elections being cancelled.
Other parties representing smaller communities were more divided in their position.
Those that had joined the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition were ready to participate in the elections, while other parties stated to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that conditions for credible elections were not present and they would therefore boycott the elections.
Members of minority communities and parties representing them, particularly the ethnic-Albanians, participated in protests across the country, individually, with other communities and as part of the Protestiram movement.
In some areas, the protest had an inter-ethnic character, with symbols of the country’s  flag  and  of  the  ethnic-Albanian  and  Roma  community  displayed  together.
A demonstration organized by the Albanian Opposition Council, in which the party Levizja Besa plays a primary role, attracted a large number of supporters, advancing demands for the ethnic-Albanian community and accusing DUI of not adequately representing the community’s interests.
Almost  all  representatives  of  national  minorities,  particularly  those  of  smaller  communities, advocated to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM the introduction of a single nationwide electoral district, as well as the creation of other special measures to promote national minorities, including reserved seats.
In their view, these measures would allow parties representing smaller communities to run separately and not necessarily align with existing coalitions.
Several OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors shared their concerns that the Roma community may be susceptible  to  political  pressure  and  selling  and  buying  of  votes.
At  the  same  time,  the OSCE/ODHIR EOM was informed of numerous initiatives aimed at raising awareness within the same community, which in some cases reportedly resulted in curbing such practice.
RECOMMENDATIONS
These recommendations, as contained throughout the text, are offered with a view to enhance the conduct of elections in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to support efforts to bring them fully in line with OSCE commitments and other international obligations and standards for democratic  elections.
These  recommendations  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  past OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, in particular from the 2014 Final Report, which remain to be addressed.
The OSCE/ODIHR stands ready to assist the authorities to further improve the electoral process and to address the recommendations contained in this and previous reports.
PRIORITY RECOMMENDATIONS
The Electoral Code would benefit from a complete review in order to harmonize it internally and with other relevant laws.
The review should be conducted after consultations between all political stakeholders and relevant civil society organizations.
It should be completed well in advance of the next elections.
Training for electoral staff and public awareness programmes should be undertaken to enhance the effective implementation of the Code.
As required by law and in order to increase transparency and public confidence in its work, all SEC sessions should be open to public; all SEC decisions should be published on their website without delay.
The SEC and MoIA should continue the process of updating of voter register though a co-ordinated effort according to clear responsibilities and procedures.
Adequate resources and time should be allocated to accomplish this task before the next elections.
This process should be transparent and ensure access to political parties and civil society.
It should be accompanied by a public information campaign in order to increase the citizens’ confidence in the accuracy of voter registration.
The allocation of state advertisements should be done in a transparent, objective and non-discriminatory manner, including by providing detailed information on the substance and funds for such advertisements.
The Electoral Code should be harmonized with the Constitution and state clearly that all hearings on election related cases should be held in public and that decisions are made public immediately.
OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS
Legal Framework
A review of the Electoral Code could consider including provisions to regulate the situation where only one electoral contestant is running for parliamentary elections.
Electoral System
If the current out-of-country voting system is maintained, alternative provisions should be made for voters to exercise their right to vote if voting abroad is cancelled.
To ensure equality of the vote, legislation could foresee periodic review of district boundaries by an independent body.
When district boundaries are redefined, it should be done in a timely, transparent, impartial and inclusive manner.
Election Administration
To ensure sustainability of the SEC administrative capacity, all necessary support positions should be permanent, based on open and competitive recruitment.
Consideration should be given to establishing and ensuring a more efficient communication and support from SEC to local election management bodies.
Comprehensive and standardized training for SEC local officials and MEC members should be undertaken before new elections are called.
The local offices should be provided with the necessary resources for conducting their work in a timely and effective manner.
Voter Registration
To  increase  public  confidence  and  provide  easier  access  of  voters  to  verify  voter  lists, consideration could be given to displaying printed excerpts of voter lists at locations convenient to voters, possibly at polling stations.
Candidate Registration
As previously recommended, consideration could be given to providing alternative methods for signature collection in order to reduce the potential for intimidation.
To avoid any confusion and the rejection of candidate list for technical reasons, all specific documents required for each list could be enumerated in the Electoral Code.
Campaign
Citizens, including public or state employees, should not be subject to pressure or intimidation.
Authorities should actively encourage citizens to report any cases of pressure, supported by verifiable evidence.
Any  instances and allegations of pressure  and intimidation should be thoroughly and effectively investigated and prosecuted by authorities.
Campaign Finance
Monitoring  and  supervision  of  campaign  finance  provisions  should  be  carried  out  by  an independent agency that has the necessary personnel and expertise to effectively monitor for irregularities.
Should that be the SAO, they should be provided with the adequate powers and resources.
Media
It is recommended to replace the legal requirement of MRT for exact amount of time in every newscast devoted to the coverage of campaign activities of individual parties with a more general requirement requiring impartiality and balance while respecting editorial independence of the public broadcaster.
To guarantee equitable coverage and access for all political contestants, the broadcast media should ensure balance in their news and current affairs reporting in the pre-campaign period, as required by the law.
Complaints and appeals
To  ensure  effective  remedy,  all  election-related  cases  should  be  decided  within  timely deadlines clearly stated in the law.
To allow effective legal remedy, the SEC should develop permanent instructions on complaints and  appeals  process.
Such  regulations  could  be  harmonized  with  the  new  complaint management system.
ABOUT THE OSCE/ODIHR
The Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) is the OSCE’s principal institution to assist participating States “to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, to abide by the rule of law, to promote principles of democracy and (…) to build, strengthen and protect democratic institutions, as well as promote tolerance throughout society” (1992 Helsinki Summit Document).
This is referred to as the OSCE human dimension.
The OSCE/ODIHR, based in Warsaw (Poland) was created as the Office for Free Elections at the 1990 Paris Summit and started operating in May 1991.
One year later, the name of the Office was changed to reflect an expanded mandate to include human rights and democratization.
Today it employs over 130 staff.
The OSCE/ODIHR is the lead agency in Europe in the field of election observation.
Every year, it co-ordinates and organizes the deployment of thousands of observers to assess whether elections in the OSCE region are conducted in line with OSCE Commitments, other international standards for democratic elections and national legislation.
Its unique methodology provides an in-depth insight into the electoral process in its entirety.
Through assistance projects, the OSCE/ODIHR helps participating States to improve their electoral framework.
The  Office’s  democratization  activities  include:  rule  of  law,  legislative  support,  democratic governance,  migration  and  freedom  of  movement,  and  gender  equality.
The  OSCE/ODIHR implements a number of targeted assistance programs annually, seeking to develop democratic structures.
The OSCE/ODIHR also assists participating States in fulfilling their obligations to promote and protect  human  rights  and  fundamental  freedoms  consistent  with  OSCE  human  dimension commitments.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Early Parliamentary Elections, 11 December 2016
STATEMENT OF PRELIMINARY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS
The 11 December early parliamentary elections were an essential step in resolving two years of deep political crisis.
The main political forces agreed to a series of legal and institutional changes to provide a level playing field for these elections.
Underlying issues, such as voter registration and media, are yet to  be  addressed  in  a  sustainable  manner.
The  campaign  was  competitive  but  took  place  in  an environment  characterized  by  public  mistrust  in  institutions  and  the  political  establishment,  and allegations of voter coercion.
The election administration struggled with the preparations for elections and missed a number of deadlines, but election day was generally well administered and proceeded without major incidents.
The  legal  framework  is  generally  conducive  for  the  conduct  of  democratic  elections.
Significant improvements to electoral legislation in 2015 addressed most previous OSCE/ODIHR and Council of Europe Venice Commission recommendations.
Additional amendments in 2016 introduced temporary mechanisms for the cross-party oversight of key aspects of the electoral process.
However, some recommendations remain unaddressed and certain provisions are ambiguous or conflict with other laws.
In addition, while the reform process enjoyed support from the four largest political parties, decisions were taken under time pressure and without consultation with relevant electoral stakeholders.
The State Election Commission’s (SEC) preparations for the elections were hampered by inefficient internal organization, politicized decision-making and shortened legal deadlines.
Several deadlines were missed and some procedures were not clarified.
SEC activities were not always transparent, as it often held closed sessions and did not always publish its decisions.
The lower-level commissions generally worked in a professional manner, although some lacked adequate premises, timely funding and equipment.
In total, 1,784,416 voters were registered.
To address longstanding mistrust in the accuracy of voter lists, for the first time the SEC reviewed the voter register by cross-checking several databases and conducting field-checks.
The review does not guarantee sustainable improvement as it applied only in these elections.
The legal and structural flaws for maintaining the voter register are yet to be addressed.
The review process improved the accuracy of the voter register, but it appears to have led to some citizens being deprived of the opportunity to vote in these elections.
The SEC registered six political parties and five coalitions for these elections.
The registration was generally inclusive, but was negatively affected by a lack of legal clarity on procedures and the rejection of candidate lists of two parties on inconsistent grounds.
In line with an enhanced quota for women’s participation, 41 per cent of candidates were women, although they topped only 4 of the 58 lists.
While fundamental freedoms were generally respected and contestants were able to campaign freely, the elections took place in an environment characterized by a lack of public trust in institutions and the political establishment.
Allegations of voter intimidation, widespread pressure on civil servants, vote buying, coercion, and misuse of administrative resources persisted throughout the campaign.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM verified a dozen of these allegations.
Such actions are at odds with OSCE commitments and Council of Europe standards.
The campaign finance regulations are comprehensive and require frequent reporting by contestants.
However, transparency is diminished by the lack of requirement to support the reports with bank statements and receipts.
Reports submitted by contestants on 1 and 10 December revealed significant overspending, particularly by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE).
The diverse media environment is split along political and ethnic lines.
Candidates could campaign on public and private media through free and paid political advertisement.
OSCE/ODIHR EOM media monitoring showed that the public media largely provided contestants with equitable news coverage.
Some of the monitored private media demonstrated bias in favor of the ruling party.
A number of interlocutors, including journalists, expressed concern about self-censorship and editorial independence due to political and business interests favouring ruling parties.
While recent amendments prohibited government-financed advertising and coverage of state officials during the campaign, significant media reforms foreseen in the Przino Agreement have yet to be implemented.
Topics related to inter-ethnic relations featured prominently in the campaign, including institutional relations between the ethnic Albanian and ethnic Macedonian communities.
The Social Democratic Union of Macedonia actively sought votes from the ethnic Albanian community, including by fielding ethnic Albanian candidates.
Media reporting of Roma candidates often used stereotypes.
Addressing a number of previous recommendations, the changes in the law and the adoption of a SEC rulebook  on  procedures  strengthened  legal  guarantees  for  dispute  resolution.
The  majority  of complaints  at  the  elections  administration  and  courts  were,  however,  rejected  on  procedural  or jurisdictional grounds.
The Administrative Court held its hearings in closed sessions.
A number of interlocutors raised concerns with respect to judicial independence.
Despite noted improvements in the law, the implementation of electoral dispute resolution procedures did not fully provide for an effective legal redress, at odds with OSCE commitments and Council of Europe standards.
Election day proceeded in an orderly manner and without major incidents, albeit with some procedural irregularities observed, particularly during the count.
Voters participated in large numbers and voting was generally assessed positively by observers.
Observers noted a number of persons not allowed to vote after having been deleted from the voter list during the recent review of the voter register.
Transparency of the electoral process benefited from the active presence of numerous citizen and party observers.
Positively, the SEC published preliminary results by polling station online throughout the night, with preliminary voter turnout at 67 per cent.
PRELIMINARY FINDINGS
Background
The 11 December early parliamentary elections were widely viewed as a crucial test for the functioning of democratic institutions, following two years of political crisis.
These elections were the fourth consecutive  early  parliamentary  elections  since  2008.
The  last  were  held  in  2014  and  led  to  a government formed by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian  National  Unity  (VMRO-DPMNE),  with  61  seats,  and  the  Democratic  Union  for Integration (DUI), with 19 seats.
The opposition included the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia  (SDSM) with 34 seats and the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) with 7 seats.
The National Democratic Revival (NDR) and Citizens Option for Macedonia had one seat each.
The main opposition party boycotted the parliament, claiming that the 2014 elections were rigged.
The crisis  deepened  in  February  2015  when  incriminating  illegal  wiretapped  recordings,  allegedly implicating government and public officials in corruption, election fraud and abuse of power, led to widespread protests.
On 15 July, as part of the internationally-mediated Przino Agreement, early parliamentary elections were called for 24 April 2016 and the Office of Special Prosecutor was created to investigate the wiretapping allegations.
The elections were postponed to 5 June on the grounds that key conditions had not been met, namely cleaning of the voter register, media reforms, and safeguards to separate state and party activities.
The political climate deteriorated after 12 April, when President Gjorge Ivanov issued a blanket pardon to all individuals who were charged, under investigation or suspected of involvement in the wiretapping scandal.
All of the major political parties condemned the pardon and called on the president to rescind his  decision.
The  pardon  triggered  protests  and  counter  protests.
The  demonstrators,  under  the Protestiram umbrella, called for the resignation of the president and cancelation of elections.
The opposition boycotted the elections and, of the four signatories of the Przino Agreement, only VMRO-DPMNE submitted candidate lists.
On 25 May, the Constitutional Court declared the dissolution of parliament unconstitutional and the 5 June elections were cancelled.
The third attempt to organize elections this year followed the signing of a new agreement in July by the four  main  political  parties,  mediated  by  the  European  Union  and  United  States.
Temporary mechanisms  were  introduced  for  cross-party  oversight  of  some  aspects  of  the  electoral  process, including voter registration and media oversight.
On 17 October, the parliament was dissolved for the second time this year and elections were called for 11 December.
Electoral System and Legal Framework
A total of 120 members of parliament (MPs) are elected in-country for a four-year term, under a proportional representation system using closed lists, 20 in each of the 6 electoral districts.
As a result of the 2015 amendments to the Electoral Code, up to three additional MPs are elected in a single out-of-country district.
The number of MPs elected in the out-of-country district does not necessarily correlate to voter turnout.
The Electoral Code permits deviations of up to five per cent from the average number of registered voters for in-country districts.
On 25 October, the Unity party challenged the holding of elections at  the Constitutional Court on the grounds that electoral district 6 deviates by 5.65 per cent.
The Court did not decide on the matter prior to election day.
The legal framework is generally conducive for the conduct of democratic elections.
In a positive step, the  electoral  legislation  was  significantly  revised  in  2015  as  part  of  the  Przino  Agreement.
The amendments addressed many previous OSCE/ODIHR and Council of Europe Venice Commission recommendations, particularly those related to the principle of equal suffrage for out-of-country voting, the composition and competences of the State Election Commission (SEC), and measures for balanced media coverage during the campaign.
They also strengthened provisions for the separation of party and the state and for campaign finance reporting.
In addition, voters can now submit a complaint at any stage  of  the  electoral  process  and  the  courts  have  to  decide  on  electoral  disputes  within  shorter deadlines.
Following the July agreement, additional amendments introduced a Temporary Commission for media oversight and required citizens with “questionable” voter registration data to actively re-register for these elections.
These last provisions were applicable only to the current elections, signalling a need for continued reform to address these issues in a sustainable manner.
The 2015 amendments improved the Electoral Code, but some longstanding issues remain unaddressed, including in respect of candidate registration, withdrawal of candidates and lists, and public and periodic review of district boundaries by an independent body.
Some articles are ambiguous or conflict with other laws and rules, making their implementation uncertain.
In addition, the legal changes were approved hastily by the parliament, after a reform process that lacked transparency and meaningful consultation  with  affected  stakeholders  outside  of  the  four  main  parties,  including  relevant  state institutions, other political parties and civil society.
This is at odds with OSCE commitments.
Election Administration
The elections are administered by the SEC, 80 Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), and 3,480 Electoral Boards (EBs).
An additional 46 EBs were established in diplomatic-consular offices for out-of-country voting.
The SEC is composed of nine members: three nominated by ruling parliamentary parties, three by opposition parties, and three independent experts selected in an open recruitment.
The president and deputy are elected from among the independent members.
MECs are composed of five randomly selected civil servants and were appointed for five-year terms in April 2016.
EBs were composed of three  randomly  selected  civil  servants,  one  member  appointed  by  the  governing  parties  and  one member appointed from the opposition parties, appointed for four-year terms in November 2016.
Despite some late changes in the composition of MECs and EBs, requirements for balanced ethnic and gender representation in election commissions were broadly respected.
However, only two of the nine SEC members are women.
The SEC’s preparations for these elections were hampered by inefficient internal organization and politicized  decision-making.
Several  important  deadlines  were  missed,  but  the  preparations  were  completed by election day.
The shortened timeframe for early elections also negatively impacted the SEC’s  activities.
SEC  decisions  were  generally  adopted  unanimously.
However,  on  politically contentious  issues  members  voted  along  party  lines  and  often  engaged  in  lengthy  procedural discussions that included heated exchanges on interpretations of the law.
At times, decisions were clearly partisan.
For example, the SEC determined the order of candidate lists on the ballots by drawing lots,  but  divided  the  lists  in  two  groups  with  the  first  places  on  the  ballot  offered  to  the  four parliamentary  parties  represented  in  the  SEC.
This  discriminated  against  other  contestants, challenging  OSCE  commitments  and  Council  of  Europe  standards.
However,  no  contestant complained on the matter.
Measures to ensure SEC transparency were not always respected.
While all members, candidates and proxies were notified about relevant SEC sessions, not all decisions were published on its website, as required by law.
The obligation to publish the minutes of the SEC sessions within 48 hours was not adhered to consistently.
Although official sessions were open to observers and media, the SEC often conducted private working sessions where substantive matters to be decided in the public sessions was agreed upon in advance.
This included decisions on tendering procedures for selection of contractors for different activities.
These practices diminished the transparency of the SEC’s work.
The  lower-level  commissions  generally  worked  in  a  professional  and  transparent  manner.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM observed that some MECs lacked adequate premises and equipment at the time of visits.
A number of MECs informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that they did not receive the necessary funds in a timely manner.
The SEC conducted cascade trainings and produced an e-learning programme, manuals and videos for election commissions.
The trainings observed by the OSCE/ODIHR EOM were comprehensive and were assessed positively by the participants.
The SEC, however, did not clarify certain procedures that were not elaborated in the Code.
The lack of clarity contributed to an inconsistent implementation of procedures by election commissions on election day.
The SEC conducted a limited voter education campaign on television, social media and print media.
Civil society organizations also developed voter awareness campaigns on secrecy of vote and voter participation.
Voter Registration
Voter registration is passive, with the exception of voters temporarily residing abroad who  must actively register.
According to the Constitution, citizens 18 years old by election day are eligible to vote, unless deprived of their legal capacity by a court decision.
However, only voters with a valid identification card or biometric passport, and registered domicile, are included in the voter register.
The Electoral Code contains conflicting provisions regarding eligibility of out-of-country voters.
For the first time in these elections, voters’ photographs were placed on the voter lists.
The SEC is responsible for maintaining the voter register.
Following the Przino Agreement, and as a means to address longstanding mistrust in the accuracy of voter lists, the SEC was tasked to review the voter register by cross-checking entries against the databases of 11 state institutions, followed by field checks.
The review process was observed by the four largest parties and led to 39,502 voter records being identified as “questionable”.
These citizens were required to re-register in order not to be deleted from the register, as per a new legal requirement.
While the process improved the accuracy of the voter register, it appears to have deprived some citizens of the opportunity to vote.
On 13 November, the SEC decided to delete 28,341 records; such voters did not have the possibility of legal redress that would allow them to be added to voter lists and be able to vote on election day.
Another 171,500 voters were moved to a separate register considered to be temporarily living abroad, but they could still vote in-country at their registered address.
In addition to the possibility of verifying their registration throughout the year, voters could check and amend their registration details at SEC regional centres during a public scrutiny period, from 28 October to 11 November.
In spite of a legal requirement, the SEC regional offices did not display printed voter lists and voters who visited the offices could only check their data on SEC computers.
Voters could also check their personal data online as well as who is registered at other addresses.
According to the SEC, few of the 10,274 voters who visited the SEC offices requested corrections.
The SEC approved 20,573 and rejected 458 applications for voting abroad.
Numerous applications were submitted from the same email address, with a significant number from the same Internet Protocol addresses in Skopje, Bitola and Shtip.
Several OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors raised questions about the integrity of the process.
Some political parties informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that they assisted voters with applications.
Voters were required to declare their ethnicity, which, according to the SEC, was necessary to print electoral materials in minority languages.
On 18 November, two days after the legal deadline, the SEC provided electoral contestants with copies of the preliminary voter lists.
The SDSM requested the addition of 45 persons who recently renewed their identification cards, as well as the addition of 348 voters identified through field checks conducted by the party and the deletion of about 800 voters who were not found at their home address.
The DUI requested the addition of five voters, whose applications were delayed by regional SEC offices.
The  SEC rejected the SDSM requests and accepted the DUI request.
The SEC also approved 107 of the 120 deletions requested by a civil society organization.
On 28 November, two days after the official date for closing the voter lists, the SEC announced that 1,784,416 voters were registered to vote in-country, of which 230,122 were placed on the special list of voters considered to be temporarily living abroad.
Special lists were also created for 2,015 prisoners, 13 internally displaced persons and 325 members of out-of-country EBs.
The political agreement to review the voter register only applied for these elections.
In addition, the legal and structural flaws for  maintaining the voter  register, mainly  due to citizens registered at addresses where they do not actually live, were not addressed.
Candidate Registration
Any eligible voter can be a candidate for parliament, except those sentenced by a final court decision to more than six months imprisonment and who have not completed their sentence.
Registered political parties, coalitions of political parties, and groups of voters can nominate candidates.
The latter were required to provide at least 1,000 supporting signatures of voters residing in the respective district.
In line with a previous OSCE/ODIHR and Venice Commission recommendation, for the first time, a voter could sign in support of more than one candidate list; however, the signatures are still required to be collected in front of a SEC employee.
Candidate registration took place from 18 October to 11 November and was generally inclusive.
However, it was negatively affected by a lack of legal clarity on several aspects of nomination and registration, including signature verification and re-submission of registration documents, 27 and by SEC inconsistency in verifying the documentation.
This led to the rejection of a number of lists from the  Social  Democratic  Party  of  Macedonia  (SDPM)  and  the  People’s  Movement  for  Macedonia (NDM).
The two parties appealed the SEC decisions to the Administrative Court, which upheld the SEC decisions.
The SEC registered 6 political parties and 5 coalitions fielding a total of 1,092 candidates on 58 lists.
In line with an enhanced quota to increase women’s participation, 41 per cent of candidates were  women, although only 4 of the 58 lists were topped by women.
The SEC registered the out-of-country candidate list for VMRO-PP and two in-country lists of Levica despite not fulfilling the gender requirement.
Campaign Environment
The parties were generally able to campaign freely, and the fundamental freedoms of association, assembly and expression were respected.
The campaign took place in an environment characterized by lack of public trust in the institutions and political establishment.
Contestants campaigned through door-to-door canvassing, small scale meetings and rallies.
Billboards were visible in many municipalities from the four main parties.
However, the placing of campaign posters and banners in public places varied by municipality due to the locations not being clearly marked and some local authorities not being aware of their legal obligation to designate such places.
Rallies throughout the country were generally well attended but some audiences appeared to lack enthusiasm.
Women represented an average of 20 per cent of the audience and very few were speakers.
The  VMRO-DPMNE-led  coalition  benefited  from  public  support,  including  at  rallies,  of  senior officials from EU member states.
Social media was extensively used in the campaign, including by smaller parties.
The main campaign messages focused on the economy, youth emigration and job creation.
While the majority of contestants used positive campaigning, negative rhetoric was also noted.
The VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition used nationalistic messages and accused the SDSM-led coalition of attempting to weaken the national identity, presenting the elections as a referendum on a unitary and sovereign state.
In turn, the SDSM-led coalition accused the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition of abusing state power and criminal activity.
The campaigns of the ethnic Albanian parties addressed only their communities.
Persistent allegations of voter intimidation, coercion, pressure on civil servants, vote buying in Roma communities  and  misuse  of  administrative  resources  negatively  impacted  the  campaign.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM verified a dozen of these allegations.
Such actions raised concerns about voters’ ability to cast their vote “free of fear of retribution”, as required by paragraph 7.7 of the 1990 OSCE Copenhagen Document.
During the campaign a number of violent incidents were observed, targeting a range of political parties.
The  campaign  within  the  ethnic  Albanian  community  was  more  intense,  with  some inflammatory  rhetoric  from  DPA,  BESA,  Alliance  for  Albanians  and  DUI.
New  wiretapped  conversations of DUI officials were posted on social media during the campaign.
Several parties claimed difficulties opening campaign offices in specific areas controlled by DUI.
Campaign Finance
Electoral contestants were required to open a dedicated bank account for campaign finance purposes.
Individuals could donate up to EUR 3,000, while legal entities could donate up to EUR 30,000.
Foreign and anonymous donations, as well as those from state-owned, religious and charitable organizations, are prohibited.
Contestants could spend a maximum of EUR 1.8 per registered voter in a district.
Lists will be reimbursed by EUR 0.25 for each vote won, provided it obtains at least 1.5 per cent of the votes cast in the district.
All  11  electoral  contestants  submitted  interim  campaign  finance  reports  on  1  and  10  December, declaring donations received and expenditures, which were published online.
The expenditures in nine reports exceeded the contributions, with VMRO-DPMNE having the highest discrepancy amounting to more than EUR 600,000 in the first report and EUR 1 million in the second.
The reports submitted by BESA and VMRO-PP contained donations that exceeded the permitted limit.
All contestants are obliged to submit final reports within 30 days from the closing of the account, which can be up to four months after the elections.
The campaign finance regulations are comprehensive and require frequent reporting by contestants.
However, transparency is diminished by the lack of requirement to support the reports with bank statements and receipts.
The State Audit Office informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that it can conduct an audit, including a cross-check of expenses at local level, but only following complaints.
Media
Numerous media, including over 130 broadcasters, operate in a relatively small market with media outlets divided along political and ethnic lines.
Substantial media reforms foreseen in the Przino Agreement have yet to be agreed upon.
The Electoral Code governs the media coverage of elections.
All broadcasters are required to provide balanced  coverage  during  the  campaign  period.
The  public  broadcaster,  Macedonian  Radio  and Television (MRT) is required to grant access to free airtime, organize debates and provide contestants with  prescribed  shares  of  news  coverage.
Amendments  in  2015  prohibit  government-financed advertising  and  coverage  of  state  officials  favouring  political  parties  during  elections.
Additional amendments in 2016, applicable only for these elections, provided for the appointment of an MRT1 editor-in-chief nominated by the opposition 100 days prior to elections (whose mandate will end on  election night), and the formation of a Temporary Commission to oversee media coverage during the pre-electoral period.
The Temporary Commission was mandated to supervise the media for more than three months prior to elections.
However, certain legal provisions were not fully harmonized with other sections of the Electoral Code, which strictly regulate the coverage of contestants only during the official 20-day campaign, creating uncertainty about its mandate.
The Commission has proposed 57 misdemeanor procedures, primarily in connection with unbalanced coverage, hidden campaigning by government officials, and paid political advertising.
Before election day, the court decided on two cases by rejecting them.
Although required by law, the AVMS did not supervise the election coverage in the electronic media, due to unclear regulations.
All electoral contestants were able to access the media for campaigning, including through free airtime in public broadcast media and paid advertising.
Some non-parliamentary parties complained about insufficient opportunities to present their messages in the media, including limits on advertisement in private  broadcast  media.
Attempts  to  organize  debates  with  all  key  contestants  were  largely unsuccessful due to refusals of candidates to participate.
Many  OSCE/ODIHR  EOM  interlocutors,  including  journalists,  noted  self-censorship  and  lack  of editorial independence of media due to the political or business interests of the owners.
During the campaign, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM was informed of one case of alleged intimidation of a news editor by a DUI representative.
Interlocutors also raised concerns about the use of government-financed media campaigns (on hold during the electoral period) as a way to sustain and reward friendly outlets.
The  OSCE/ODIHR  EOM  media  monitoring  results  showed  that  both  public  television  channels complied with the regulation on distribution of coverage between the groups in the campaign period.
In MRT1 news programmes, the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition and DUI received 20 per cent of coverage each, while the opposition parties were allocated 42 per cent, and non-parliamentary parties 11 per cent.
On MRT2, the distribution of coverage between governing and opposition parties was similarly  equitable,  with  more  time  dedicated  to  the  ethnic  Albanian  parties.
MRT1  and  MRT2 portrayed the competitors overall in a positive and uncritical manner.
The private Sitel, Kanal 5 and Alfa failed to provide balanced and impartial coverage in their news.
Although they allocated equitable portions of airtime mainly to VMRO-DPMNE and SDSM, the former was very positive in tone and the latter was often negative, in particular on Sitel.
All three channels were openly supporting the ruling party and focusing on VMRO-DPMNE campaign topics.
Dubious information originating from Internet was occasionally presented as political news on these channels.
Other private channels, Alsat-M, Telma and 24 Vesti, offered diverse and frequently critical coverage of the main contestants and political actors in their news programmes, and also granted to contestants  opportunities  to  present  their  platforms  in  debates  or  interviews.
Monitored  newspapers  overall provided variety of views, while leaning towards particular parties.
Participation of National Minorities
Parties  and  coalitions  primarily  representing  the  ethnic  Albanian  community  ran  independently, whereas  parties  and  candidates  representing  smaller  communities  joined  coalitions  led  by  parties representing larger communities.
Both the SDSM-led and VMRO-DPMNE-led coalitions included in their lists representatives of almost all smaller communities, some in likely winnable positions.
As in the past, the majority of parties representing smaller communities ran under the VMRO-DPMNE-led coalition.
The  SDSM-led  coalition  actively  sought  votes  from  the  ethnic  Albanian  community, including by fielding ethnic Albanian candidates in winnable positions, which unfortunately was not well received by established ethnic Albanian parties.
Topics related to inter-ethnic relations featured prominently in the campaign, including institutional relations between the ethnic Albanian and Macedonian communities and the official use of languages.
The electoral contest was particularly competitive in the ethnic Albanian communities.
The Alliance for  Albanians  and  BESA  challenged  the  dominant  position  of  DUI.
Media  coverage  of  smaller communities and their participation in the elections, including rallies and statements by parties, was limited.
Reporting  on  political  activities  by  smaller  communities,  particularly  Roma,  often  used negative stereotypes.
While electoral materials were provided in national minority languages, there was no specific voter education campaign to reach out to smaller communities or in their languages.
Complaints and Appeals
The SEC dealt with most administrative disputes related to elections, and the SAO and SCPC handled complaints  related  to  campaign  finance  and  misuse  of  administrative  resources  respectively.
Amendments  to  the  Electoral  Code  in  2015  strengthened  legal  guarantees  for  electoral  dispute resolution.
In  line  with  previous  OSCE/ODIHR  and  Venice  Commission  recommendations,  this included shorter deadlines, publication of administrative decisions within 24 hours, and guaranteeing the right to appeal all administrative decisions to the Administrative Court.
In addition, following previous recommendations, the SEC adopted a rulebook on procedures for dealing with complaints.
The SEC received 11 complaints prior to election day, the majority of which were dismissed due to a lack of jurisdiction or evidence.
Despite the legal obligation, the SEC did not implement an electronic system for case and complaint management.
Two decisions regarding the rejection of the SDPM and NDM lists were appealed to the Administrative Court and both were rejected, in closed session, as ungrounded.
Although both decisions were published on its website, the lack of public hearings is  contrary  to  OSCE  commitments  and  other  international  obligations.
In  addition,  a  number  of interlocutors raised concerns with judicial independence.
Overall, despite improvements in the law, the implementation of electoral dispute resolution procedures did not fully provide for an effective system of redress, at odds with OSCE commitments and Council of Europe standards.
The SCPC received some 1,000 requests for clarifications on issues related to misuse of administrative resources, many of which were anonymous or submitted with little evidence.
On 1 December, the SCPC requested the Basic Public Prosecution to initiate an investigation in two.
In addition, the Ombudsman initiated 10 investigations related to allegations of pressure on public employees and corrections in voter lists, which are ongoing.
Two other initiatives were submitted to the Constitutional Court challenging the constitutionality of election-related provisions.
On 9 November, the Constitutional Court rejected both: one from BESA, challenging the provision which required voters with “questionable” voter registration data to re-register  (no  jurisdiction)  and  one  from  NDM,  challenging  the  composition  of  the  Temporary Commission (ungrounded).
Election Observation
The Electoral Code allows for citizen, party and international observation.
Two citizen observer groups observed the elections: MOST deployed 80 LTOs and some 3,300 STOs, and CIVIL deployed 35 LTOs and some 300 STOs.
MOST also conducted parallel vote tabulation.
The participation of citizen observers at all stages of the electoral process contributed to the transparency of the elections.
Ten civil society organizations, working on voter awareness campaign, were notified of forthcoming financial audits before and soon after election day.
These organizations questioned the timing of such inquiry.
Early Voting and Election Day
Early voting and election day generally proceeded in an orderly manner and without major incidents or tension.
Transparency benefited from the presence of numerous citizen and party observers throughout the day (76 and 97 per cent, respectively) in the polling stations observed.
Early voting took place on 7 December for members of out-of-country EBs and on 10 December for homebound voters, internally displaced persons, detainees and prisoners.
Early voting was assessed positively in all but 3 observations.
Procedural problems observed related to ballot boxes not being properly sealed in 7 cases, and the secrecy of the vote not always ensured in 8 cases.
During voting at the country’s largest prison, Idrizovo, the observers noted several prisoners with valid ID being unable to vote because they were not on the voter list.
Over 500 prisoners were not included in the list due to expired IDs.
There is no procedure to renew the expired ID of prisoners.
On election day, almost all of the observed polling stations opened on time.
The opening process was assessed positively in most areas, however, observers noted procedural problems: in 20 cases the  required protocol was not filled in prior to voting, in 21 cases the ballot boxes were not shown to be empty, and in 10 cases the numbers of ballot box security seals were not recorded.
The voting process was assessed positively in 97 per cent of observations.
Procedures were generally followed, including those to safeguard against multiple voting such as inking of voters’ fingers and checking the photos on the voter list.
The layout of 4 per cent of polling stations observed was assessed as inadequate.
In half of these cases, this impacted on the secrecy of the vote.
Overcrowding was noted in 5 per cent of the polling stations visited.
More than half of the polling stations observed did not allow for independent access for voters with disabilities.
Significantly, in 16 per cent of the observed polling stations, persons were not allowed to vote as they were not on the voter lists.
While some of these citizens were redirected to other polling stations, others stated that they were part of the 28,341 records deleted in July 2016.
A total of 335 of the affected persons  submitted  complaints  to  the  SEC  on  this  matter.
This  highlights  the  continued  need  to sustainably address the structural flaws in the voter register.
Some serious irregularities were observed during voting, such as group voting (4 per cent), proxy voting (2 per cent), ballot boxes not sealed properly (2 per cent).
Incidents of voters being pressured and unauthorized persons directing the work of EBs were also observed.
During the day, a number of police and media reports informed of irregularities related to vote buying and photographing of ballots.
At least six people were arrested.
The counting process was assessed as efficient and transparent by the IEOM observers.
However, significant procedural omissions were observed in a number of polling stations and the counting was assessed negatively in 10 EBs observed.
This primarily related to steps taken prior to opening the ballot boxes, including counting the number of signatures and unused ballots (28 and 25 cases, respectively), and verifying the numbers of the ballot box security seals (14 cases).
Following the count, 16 EBs observed had difficulties filling in the results protocols, and 14 EBs did not follow the procedures for packing sensitive election materials and ballots.
Copies of the protocol were given to those who requested them; however, 33 EBs observed did not post the protocols, as required by law.
The counting finished by the midnight deadline in all polling stations observed.
Tabulation proceeded in a timely manner but was assessed negatively in 8 observations.
The main problems noted related to the conditions at MECs: insufficient space (24 MECs), overcrowding (22 MECs),  and  poor  organization  (9  MECs).
During  the  observation,  336  counting  protocols  had discrepancies and the ballots from 40 polling stations were recounted.
While not required by law, preliminary results by polling station and district were published online by the  SEC  throughout  the  night,  which  contributed  to  the  transparency  of  the  process.
The  SEC announced preliminary voter turnout at 67 per cent.
