The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
Early Parliamentary Elections, 5 June 2016
INTERIM REPORT
31 March – 19 April 2016
22 April 2016
I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On 15 April, early parliamentary elections were officially called for 5 June.
The main opposition party and some 20 smaller parties have announced their intention to boycott the elections, arguing that key Przino Agreement conditions had not been met, specifically cleaning of the voter register, media reforms and separation of party and state activities.
The political climate deteriorated after 12 April, when President Ivanov pardoned all those charged, under investigation and suspected in the so-called “wiretapping scandal”.
All of the major political parties condemned the pardon and called on the president to rescind his decision.
The Electoral Code was substantially amended in November 2015.
While these amendments address most of the previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendations and represent an effort to improve the Code, a number of OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors stressed that full implementation of the Code is of equal importance.
Some noted that late changes may negatively affect electoral stakeholders’ understanding of how to fulfill their functions.
The new composition of the State Election Commission (SEC) comprises three independent experts, including its president and deputy, in addition to the six political nominees.
Of the nine SEC members, two are women and three are ethnic Albanians.
The SEC is working in a tense political environment and its long sessions attract significant media attention.
On 15 April, the SEC voted that they were prepared to conduct “fair and democratic elections”.
The SEC president and two opposition representatives refused to take part in this vote.
The SEC now carries sole responsibility for maintaining the voter register.
In February, the SEC started the process of cleaning the voter register by cross-checking various databases, as well as by conducting field verifications.
OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors stated that the process was complex, methodologically challenging and requiring major resources.
While the legal framework provides for equitable treatment of political parties by media, most OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors raised concerns regarding the deterioration of media freedom due to political pressure and media owners interfering in the work of journalists.
They also highlighted the need for substantial reforms.
On 4 April, the parliament dismissed draft amendments to the media legislation put forward by a coalition of civil society organizations.
The citizen observer organizations MOST and CIVIL announced their intention to observe the elections.
On 5 April, the Financial Police began an investigation of MOST activities, and some OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors questioned the timing of this inquiry.
II. INTRODUCTION
Following an official invitation, and based on the recommendation of a Needs Assessment Mission conducted from 2 to 5 November 2015, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (OSCE/ODIHR) established an Election Observation Mission (EOM) on 31 March to observe the 5 June early parliamentary elections.
The EOM, headed by Ambassador Jan Petersen, consists of a 12-member core team based in Skopje and 24 long-term observers (LTOs) deployed throughout the country on 13 April.
Mission members are drawn from 21 OSCE participating States.
Participating States have been requested to second 300 short-term observers to observe election day procedures.
III. BACKGROUND AND POLITICAL CONTEXT
The last parliamentary elections were held on 27 April 2014 and resulted in a government formed by a coalition of Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE) with 61 seats, and Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) with 19 seats.
The opposition included the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) with 34 seats and the Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) with 7 seats.
The National Democratic Revival (NDR) and Citizens Option for Macedonia (GROM) had one seat each.
Following the elections, SDSM refused to take up their mandates and boycotted the work of the parliament alleging that the elections were not legitimate due to electoral fraud, intimidation of citizens and inadequate separation of state and party activities.
The political crisis deepened in February 2015 with the so-called “wiretapping scandal”, when incriminating wiretapped recordings allegedly implicated government and public officials in corruption, election fraud and abuse of power were released and led to a series of large-scale protests.
Representatives of the European Commission and the European Parliament facilitated a political agreement between the four major parties resulting in the signing of the Przino Agreement on 2 June and a Protocol on 15 July.
The Agreement called for a “transitional period” followed by early parliamentary elections on 24 April 2016.
An interim government was installed on 11 November, followed by the resignation of the prime minister on 15 January 2016.
SDSM announced in the beginning of 2016 that they would not participate in the elections scheduled for 24 April, stating that key Przino Agreement conditions had not been met, specifically cleaning of the voter register, media reforms, and separation of state and party activities.
On 23 February, the European Union (EU) and United States (US) ambassadors to Skopje released a joint assessment concluding that although some progress had been made, conditions for organizing credible elections were not in place.
The same day, the parliament approved a DUI motion to postpone the dissolution of the parliament until 7 April.
A day before the scheduled dissolution of the parliament, SDSM announced their intention to withdraw their representatives from the interim government; this matter was not, however, put on the parliamentary agenda.
On 7 April parliament was dissolved, and on 15 April the parliament speaker called elections for 5 June.
SDSM, along with 13 parties signed a Platform for a Democratic Macedonia calling for the implementation of Przino Agreement and announced a boycott of these elections.
The political climate deteriorated after 12 April, when President Gjorge Ivanov issued a blanket pardon to all individuals who were charged, under investigation or suspected of involvement in the wiretap scandal.
All of the major political parties condemned the pardon and called on the president to rescind his decision.
The pardon triggered protests and counter protests, some violent.
These recent events have further exacerbated the tense and uncertain political situation and increased the exchange of harsh rhetoric between all parties, and particularly between VMRO-DPMNE and SDSM.
IV. LEGAL FRAMEWORK AND ELECTORAL SYSTEM
The elections are regulated by the Constitution and the Electoral Code, supplemented by regulations promulgated by the State Election Commission (SEC).
The Electoral Code was adopted in 2006 but has undergone a number of changes since then.
Following the Przino Agreement, a working group was created with the participation of VMRO-DPMNE, SDSM, DUI and DPA.
The group reached consensus on electoral reform in November 2015, and on 9 November the parliament adopted a significant number of amendments.
The amendments addressed most of the prior OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, particularly those related to the principle of equal suffrage for out-of-country voting, the composition and competences of the SEC, level playing field in terms of media coverage during the election period, strengthening party and campaign finance reporting and auditing, improving safeguards for the separation of party and state, introducing deadlines for courts to decide on electoral disputes and clarifying the definition of campaigning and campaign period.
While the amendments represent an effort to improve the Electoral Code, a number of OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors stressed that full implementation of the Code is of equal importance.
They also expressed the opinion that late changes may negatively affect electoral stakeholders’ understanding of new provisions and impact on their ability to fulfill their functions.
Between 120 and 123 members of parliament (MPs) will be elected under a proportional representation system, using closed lists.
Of these, 20 MPs will be elected in each of the 6 in-country electoral districts with similar number of voters.
As a result of the 2015 amendments to the Electoral Code, up to 3 MPs can be elected from a single out-of-country district.
V. ELECTION ADMINISTRATION
Elections are administered by the SEC, 80 Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), and some 3,500 Electoral Boards (EBs), including 53 abroad.
Following the Przino Agreement, the SEC composition was increased from seven to nine members, including three independent experts selected by the parliament in an open recruitment process.
Ruling and opposition party blocs in the parliament nominated three additional members each.
The new SEC was appointed by the parliament on 16 December 2015, five month later than called for in the Przino Agreement.
The SEC president and his deputy were elected from among the non-partisan members.
MECs are composed of five members who are randomly selected by the SEC from employees of the state and municipal administration.
As the mandate of current MECs expires on 28 April, the SEC should appoint new MECs by the same date.
EBs comprise five members – three randomly selected public employees and two appointees of the main ruling and opposition parties.
A submitter of the list of candidates has the right to appoint an observer to each election administration body.
The Electoral Code provides for equitable representation of ethnic groups and each gender in election administration bodies.
Of the nine SEC members, two are women and three are ethnic Albanians.
While by law all sessions should be public, the SEC also convened in working meetings closed for media and observers.
The SEC is working in a tense political environment and its long sessions attract significant media attention.
On 15 April, after a discussion between SEC and the US and EU ambassadors, the SEC publicly discussed and voted with six votes in favour that they were prepared to conduct “fair and democratic elections”.
The SEC president and the two SDSM representatives refused to vote and left the meeting.
VI. VOTER REGISTRATION
All citizens over the age of 18 years are eligible to vote unless disenfranchised by a final court decision.
Voter registration is passive, with the exception of voters temporarily residing abroad who must actively register.
Voting rights are granted to persons with a registered residence in the country who have a biometric identification card or passport.
The accuracy of the voter register remains one of the most contentious issues in the ongoing political crisis.
Following the 2015 changes to the Electoral Code, the SEC carries sole responsibility for maintaining voter register based on data extracted from civil and population registers.
In February, the SEC started the cleaning of the voter register by cross-checking the databases of 11 state institutions, as well as by conducting field verifications.
OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors stated that the process proved complex, methodologically challenging as well as requiring major resources.
Out of approximately 1.8 million voters, some 330,000 were identified as needing clarification of their status.
The SEC searched for inconsistencies in the databases and analyzed data that could indicate possible irregularities, such as deceased persons remaining on the lists, large number of voters registered at the same addresses or voters with similar names and birthdays.
Some 220,000 records were forwarded for additional clarifications to the MoIA and several other state institutions.
The SEC published a list of some 89,000 citizens whose registration data were to be confirmed during field visits at voters’ residence between 28 March and 5 April.
Following an intervention by the Directorate for Personal Data Protection on 30 March, the SEC removed this list from its website, along with the national list with voters’ addresses.
Over 550 SEC representatives visited the households of some 87,000 voters, filling out questionnaires that were later uploaded in the SEC database.
Some 35,000 voters were met in person, and 41,000 were not present but their data was checked.
Over 10,000 forms did not indicate if a voter was met in person or not.
The SEC removed over 1,100 deceased persons from the voter register and is currently awaiting a response from the MoIA regarding thousands of remaining records.
The cleaning of the voter register will continue in the electoral period.
The voter lists are expected to be posted for public scrutiny from 25 April, and political parties will be able to challenge any records.
For the first time in these elections, on election day voters’ photo should be placed on the voter lists.
VII. CANDIDATE REGISTRATION
Any eligible voter can be a candidate, except those who have been sentenced by a final court decision to more than six months imprisonment and did not complete their sentence.
The law also identifies a range of government and government-related positions that are incompatible with candidacy.
Candidates can be nominated by political parties, coalitions of political parties, or by groups of voters.
Candidate lists submitted by groups of voters are required to provide at least 1,000 supporting signatures of voters residing in the respective district.
In line with a previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendation, a voter can now sign in support of more than one prospective contestant, however, signatures must be collected in front of a regional SEC representative.
Candidate lists should be submitted to the SEC not later than 11 May with the candidate registration process to conclude by 13 May.
In an effort to encourage the participation of women, the Electoral Code now provides that at least 40 percent of candidates must belong to the less represented gender.
VIII. CAMPAIGN AND CAMPAIGN FINANCE
The official election campaign will begin on 16 May, and will end 24 hours before election day.
Following previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, the use of administrative resources for campaigning, including the use of office premises, office equipment and official vehicles is explicitly prohibited.
The Code now forbids pressuring or intimidating voters and obliges all electoral contestants to sign a Code on Fair and Democratic Elections as a guarantee.
Displaying campaign posters free of charge is allowed only at locations determined by each municipality.
Posters can be posted on private buildings only with the permission of the owner.
While most forms of campaigning are not allowed until 16 May, political advertising on billboards and advertising panels is permitted.
The political parties have the right to rent advertising panels and billboards in a transparent manner.
The Electoral Code regulates the financing of election campaigns.
All campaign-related donations and expenditures must go through a bank account.
Eligible private persons are allowed to donate up to the equivalent of EUR 3,000 in MKD, while legal entities may donate up to EUR 30,000.
Foreign or anonymous donations, as well as those from state-owned, religious and charitable organizations, are prohibited.
Discounts given by media outlets to campaign participants for political advertisements are considered donations.
Each electoral contestant may not spend more than EUR 1.80 (MKD 110) per registered voter in a given electoral district.
Electoral contestants have to submit two interim reports and a final campaign finance report.
In line with previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, itemized reporting on campaign finance expenditure is now required.
The supervision of campaign finance is primarily carried out by the State Audit Office.
IX. MEDIA
The media is composed of a high number of outlets, and television remains the predominant source of news and information.
OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors raised concerns regarding the deterioration of media freedom due to political pressure and owners interfering in the work of journalists.
They also highlighted the need for substantial reforms.
The OSCE Representative on Freedom of the Media also called on the authorities “to ease the pressure on media and respect free and critical voices”.
The Constitution, Law on Media and Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media Service form the legal framework for the media, which requires equal treatment of political parties.
In addition, the amended Electoral Code obliges broadcast media to cover elections in a fair, balanced and unbiased manner, providing contestants with equitable access.
Strict rules governing news coverage and reporting on regular activities of state and municipal institutions during the campaign are also introduced.
As part of the Przino Agreement, consultations between the four political parties and civil society organizations were held to further reform the media landscape, however amendments coming from civil society organizations were dismissed by the parliament on 4 April.
The Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services (AVMS), the broadcast media regulatory body, is required to conduct media monitoring of broadcast and Internet media outlets during the electoral period.
Due to the lack of a clear definition of the Internet portals in the Electoral Code, the AVMS does not intend to monitor such media.
While during the pre-campaign period the AVMS only monitors national broadcasters and checks the regional and local media outlets only in case of complaints, it will monitor all broadcast media once the campaign starts.
The Council of Media Ethics (CME), operating since early 2015, is a self–regulatory body that reviews complaints about media content.
On 12 February, most private media outlets signed CME’s “Charter on Ethical Reporting during Elections”, pledging to report in a balanced, truthful, impartial and objective manner.
Earlier in January, the public broadcaster Macedonian Radio and Television (MRT), has also adopted “Ethical and Professional Principles of MRT for Media Coverage of the Election Process”, establishing the general guidelines for the journalists to cover the elections.
On 7 April, the OSCE/ODIHR EOM commenced qualitative and quantitative media monitoring of eight television channels and five daily newspapers.
X. COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
Election related complaints may be filed by authorized representatives of candidates, by submitters of candidates’ lists as well as by voters.
The complaints are heard by the SEC, and its decisions can be appealed to the Administrative Court.
Decisions of the Administrative Court are final.
Following previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, the 2015 amendments to the Electoral Code adjusted the deadlines for hearing and deciding electoral complaints.
In addition, all hearings must be open to the public.
Decisions on complaints should be published on the websites of the Administrative Court and the SEC.
To date no complaints have been filed with the SEC or the Administrative Court.
In line with previous OSCE/ODIHR recommendations, the SEC established a legal department for handling complaints.
In addition, the Electoral Code calls for the establishment of a system for case and complaint management that is yet to be operational.
XI. PARTICIPATION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES
Inter-ethnic relations remain a relevant factor in the politics of the country, and political parties tend to mainly reach out to their own communities.
Traditionally, parties representing the Albanian community ran separately, whereas parties representing smaller communities aligned with stronger political forces in pre-election coalitions.
These smaller communities expressed concern to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM about not being involved in negotiations on the Przino Agreement.
They also claimed that parties representing larger communities use administrative resources and public employment to ensure support from minorities.
After the dissolution of the parliament, VMRO-DPMNE began forming a coalition, including some parties representing minorities.
Other such parties stated to the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that there are no conditions for credible elections, and as such they would not take part.
The Electoral Code provides for specific rights for minorities.
In municipalities where ethnic communities constitute at least 20 per cent of the population, they should be represented in MECs and EBs, and all templates and election materials, including the ballot, should also be available in the their language.
In districts where at least 20 per cent of the citizens speak one of six officially recognized minority languages, candidate lists may also be submitted in this language.
XII. CITIZEN AND INTERNATIONAL OBSERVERS
The Electoral Code provides for international and citizen election observation.
The citizen observer organizations MOST and CIVIL have announced their intention to observe these elections.
At this stage, MOST has 80 observers in 18 regional offices, and CIVIL has 35 observers in 14 regional offices as well as 12 mobile observers.
On 5 April, the Financial Police began an investigation of MOST regarding out-of-country payments to foreign consultants, and some OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors questioned the timing of this investigation.
XIII. MISSION ACTIVITIES
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM commenced its work in Skopje on 31 March.
The Head of Mission met with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the SEC, and with representatives of political parties, the OSCE Mission to Skopje and the international community.
The EOM established contacts with electoral stakeholders at all levels.
The OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (OSCE PA) and the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) intend to deploy observer delegations for election day observation.
The English version of this report is the only official document.
An unofficial translation is available in Macedonian and Albanian languages.

The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,
Early Parliamentary Elections, 5 June 2016
INTERIM REPORT 2
20 April - 11 May 2016
13 May 2016
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The coalition of the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity Party and two non-parliamentary parties submitted candidate lists to compete in these elections.
Three other parties that are signatories of the Przino Agreement call for the postponement of elections.
The political atmosphere in the country remains tense.
While the opposition and some civil society organizations are demanding a postponement of elections and calling for an increased involvement of the international community in resolving the crisis, counter-demonstrations call for elections to be held on 5 June.
All demonstrations are generally peaceful, but several arrests were made for damages caused to state buildings and monuments.
The OSCE/ODIHR Election Observation Mission (EOM) received credible allegations of pressure on public sector employees to attend the counter-demonstrations, no official complaints, however, have been filed.
The State Election Commission (SEC) continues to work in a very tense political environment.
As of 15 April, the two members nominated by SDSM have not participated in the SEC sessions.
Despite a legal obligation to meet publicly, the SEC held two closed sessions, and its decisions have not been systematically published on its website.
Many SEC regional offices complained about lack of resources and insufficient support from the headquarters.
On 28 April, the SEC appointed new members to the Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), ensuring the minimum gender and ethnic minority representation required by the law.
Of the four main parliamentary parties, it appears that only the ruling party nominated its members to the Electoral Boards (EB).
As a number of MECs are not yet operational, the appointment of EB members is delayed by several days.
Alleged irregularities in the voter list, such as fictitious voters and other fraudulent practices, are used as one of the main arguments for the postponement of the elections.
The 26 April SEC progress report on updating voter lists did not reveal evidence of voter registration fraud to date.
Some 1.8 million voters could check only their own data electronically, but not that of other citizens as required by law.
The SEC has not published the voter lists online, due to a decision of the Directorate for Personal Data Protection.
Upon a SEC appeal, the Administrative Court is yet to decide on the matter.
The first monitoring report of the Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services concluded that private broadcasters Alfa, Kanal 5, Kanal 5+, Sitel and Nova have so far failed to provide objective, equitable and unbiased coverage.
It further concluded that the first four media listed above co-ordinated their editorial policy.
The preliminary OSCE/ODIHR EOM media monitoring data shows that public MRT-1 so far provided limited information about political events.
Public MRT-2 and Alsat-M provided more coverage to the Albanian parties.
While private Sitel, Kanal 5 and Alfa show bias for VMRO-DPMNE and against SDSM, private Telma and Vesti 24 are more balanced.
No official complaints have been filed to date to SEC or courts.
Hotlines for reporting electoral violations have been established by several state institutions.
POLITICAL CONTEXT AND PRE-CAMPAIGN ENVIRONMENT
The political atmosphere in the country remains tense.
The Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity Party (VMRO-DPMNE) maintains that holding elections on 5 June is the only way out of the current political crisis, while Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) calls for postponement of elections until the Przino Agreement is fully implemented.
The Democratic Union for Integration (DUI) and Democratic Party of Albanians (DPA) stated that they stand for inclusive elections with all parties running.
A number of OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors call for an increased involvement of the international community in resolving the crisis.
A 22 April attempt by the European Union and United States to mediate the political crisis was met by an announcement by the SDSM that they would not participate in talks until the presidential pardon related to the wire-tapping scandal is withdrawn and the elections are postponed.
Discussions continue as the 11 May deadline for candidate nomination has passed and a number of parties will not participate in the elections, including SDSM, DUI and DPA.
Demonstrations and counter-demonstrations continue in Skopje and numerous other cities.
The civil movement Protestiram (I protest) mainly calls for postponement of elections, withdrawal of presidential pardon and resignation of the president.
The demonstrations have been generally peaceful, however, several arrests were made after state buildings and monuments were splattered with paint.
While the Protestiram representatives maintain their independence from any political party, VMRO-DPMNE claims that the protests are orchestrated by SDSM.
Counter-demonstrations organized by Civil Movement for Defense (GDOM) support the government position by calling for elections to be held on 5 June.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM received credible allegations of pressure on public sector employees to attend the counter-demonstrations, including threats of loss of employment, however no official complaints have been filed.
Several OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors attributed this to a culture of fear of retribution existing in state companies and institutions.
The new Electoral Code allows for the use of billboards and advertising panels for political advertising as of 20 December 2015.
However, many municipalities appeared not to be aware of the new provisions and the SEC has yet to allocate the space.
THE ELECTION ADMINISTRATION
The State Election Commission (SEC) began administrative preparations for elections and adopted an electoral calendar with legal deadlines as well as a budget for administering elections.
The SEC has held regular sessions with only seven members, as the two members nominated by the SDSM have not participated in the public sessions since 15 April.
Despite a legal obligation, the SEC held two sessions without inviting media and observers.
In addition, its formal decisions were not systematically published on its website.
The SEC continues to work in a very tense political environment and under criticism from the opposition and some civil society organizations who claim there are no conditions for holding elections on 5 June.
Civil society organizations MOST and CIVIL criticized the SEC for “failing to clean the voter lists” and to “provide conditions for fair and credible elections”.
In a public session, SEC rejected these allegations and some of its members accused both organizations of links with the SDSM.
The employees of the SEC regional offices visited by OSCE/ODIHR EOM appear to be experienced and committed to their work, but many of them complained about the lack of necessary resources and insufficient support received from the headquarters.
As the four-year mandate of Municipal Election Commissions (MECs) expired on 28 April, the SEC appointed new MEC members.
Selection was done randomly from among civil servants through a computer programme.
The minimum gender and ethnic minority representation required by the law was largely respected.
Among selected, 47 per cent of MEC members are women.
It appears that a number of MECs are not yet operational.
As the appointment of their members was not harmonized with the calendar of the 2016 elections, new members did not receive any training before commencing their duties.
In addition, OSCE/ODIHR EOM was informed that some new members were not aware of their appointments.
Some 40 MEC members requested the SEC to cancel their selection for health reasons, political party affiliation or lack of necessary education.
By the 5 May deadline, it appears that out of the four main parliamentary parties only VMRO-DPMNE nominated its representatives to the Election Boards (EB).
The appointment of EB members was due by the next day, but the EBs were not appointed in most MECs.
VOTER REGISTRATION
After a three-month effort to clean the voter register, alleged irregularities, such as fictitious voters and other fraudulent practices, are still used as one of the main arguments for the postponement of the elections.
The 26 April SEC progress report on updating voter lists did not reveal evidence of voter registration fraud to date.
Almost all of the 300,000 records initially identified as questionable were validated.
Minor changes were made, mainly by removing deceased persons.
The SEC conducted an additional check of electronic databases of some 47,000 voters who were not met in person during the field verification conducted between 28 March and 5 April.
This led to minor changes in the register.
The SEC is conducting further research of some 4,100 voters whose status was questioned as a result of an online verification.
Many OSCE/ODIHR EOM interlocutors, including some SEC regional staff, raised doubts about the usefulness of the field checks in general.
In response to 45 SEC written requests, the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MoIA) submitted verified citizen records.
Many of these requests were, however, signed only by the deputy minister, as the minister, representing SDSM, refused to do so with the argument that more time was needed to conduct accurate checks.
While the SDSM representatives at the SEC questioned the legality of such documents, the SEC decided to accept them.
In addition, the MoIA minister requested the SEC to remove some 130,000 voters who possess a passport but not a valid identification card, which he claimed is necessary to prove their residency.
The SEC rejected this request on the ground that law provides for registration of voters with either valid identification card or passport.
An ongoing concern for the SEC is the so called ‘Pustec voters’: citizens living in Albania whose voter eligibility remains in question because of unclear residency status.
These persons were allegedly added to the voter lists in Skopje Centar municipality to influence the outcome of local elections.
According to MoIA representatives, some 349 identification cards were cancelled for the reason of respective voters not having the right to register at that specific residence.
As required by the law, the public inspection of voter lists, comprising some 1.8 million voters, was conducted between 25 April and 9 May at SEC’s 34 regional and local offices.
Neither paper excerpts of the voter lists nor databases were available for voters to check the registration data of other citizens.
Instead, voters could check only their own data.
This, however, was not implemented uniformly across the country: while in some offices they could do so by their personal identification number, in others this was possible also by their name, address and polling station number.
As of 9 May, 4,700 voters verified the accuracy of their data.
The SEC has not published the voter lists on its website as required by law, due to the decision of the Directorate for Personal Data Protection prohibiting the publication of personal data of voters including name, gender, address, date of birth and polling station number.
The SEC has appealed the decision to the Administrative Court,16 which is yet to decide on the matter.
On 14 May, the SEC must share the voter lists with the political parties, which will have five days to request any changes.
The voter list update is scheduled to conclude on 22 May.
REGISTRATION OF CANDIDATES
The deadline for the submission of candidate lists was 11 May.
Of the four major parliamentary parties, only the VMRO-DPMNE coalition submitted candidate lists.
In addition, two non-parliamentary parties, the National Movement for Macedonia and the Social Democratic Party of Macedonia, nominated their candidates.
No independent lists were submitted by groups of citizens.
The SEC is to verify submitted lists for candidate eligibility and required gender representation.
Candidate registration will conclude by 14 May, and SEC decisions of non-registration can be appealed with the Administrative Court.
THE MEDIA
The Agency for Audio and Audiovisual Media Services (AVMS) is monitoring the broadcast media during the electoral period.
On 28 April, the Agency released the first report focusing on national broadcasters covering the first 10 days of this period.
The report concluded that private broadcasters Alfa, Kanal 5, Kanal 5+, Sitel and Nova failed to provide objective and unbiased coverage of the events as prescribed by Article 61 of the Law on Audio and Audiovisual Media services.
The report also concluded that the first four media listed above co-ordinated their editorial policy.
The Electoral Code requires the public broadcaster to organize debates between the ruling and the opposition parties.
MRT-1 attempted to hold two debates between VMRO-DPMNE, SDSM, DUI and DPA, but only VMRO-DPMNE chose to participate and only once.
MRT-1 also organized one debate between Citizens Option for Macedonia and Socialist Party of Macedonia, where New Social Democratic Party and Liberal Democratic Party chose not to participate despite having been invited.
The OSCE/ODIHR EOM continues qualitative and quantitative media monitoring of eight television channels and five daily newspapers.
The preliminary OSCE/ODIHR EOM media monitoring data for the period from 15 April to 11 May show that public television MRT-1 devotes most coverage to government activities, followed by reports on the VMRO-DPMNE and SDSM.
All other political parties received marginal coverage.
The Albanian language service of MRT-2 and private Alsat-M provided more coverage of the Albanian parties, particularly DUI.
Between 15 April and 11 May, the most popular private stations Sitel and Kanal 5, together with Alfa, displayed a similar approach in the news coverage, devoting most time to VMRO-DPMNE, SDSM and government.
The coverage tone was mainly positive and neutral for VMRO-DPMNE and for the counter-protests, and mainly negative of SDSM and protests calling postponement of elections.
Telma and Vesti 24 have so far provided equal coverage to VMRO-DPMNE and SDSM.
The electoral contestants are entitled to purchase paid political advertisements for the official campaign period.
The AVMS has informed the OSCE/ODIHR EOM that in total 107 broadcasters have published the pricelists, while 24 broadcasters informed AVMS that they will not sell political advertisements.
In addition, 7 newspapers and 12 web portals have submitted their pricelists.
COMPLAINTS AND APPEALS
The SEC is yet to adopt an instruction for deciding on complaints and appeals.
The electronic system for case and complaint management required by the Electoral Code has not been developed so far.
To date no official complaints have been received by the SEC or the courts.
Hotlines have been established by several state institutions: the Ministry of Information Society and Administration for public sector employees to report any pressure on them related to the elections;20 the Ombudsman Office for citizens to report violations of their electoral rights; and the Public Prosecutor’s Office for citizens and civil society organizations to report any suspicion of criminal activity related to the elections.
According to these institutions, very few calls have been received and none of them concerning serious violations.
The Public Prosecutor received 16 allegations or complaints of which 2 were referred to the relevant basic public prosecutor’s office with instructions to act urgently and report back.
No grounds of suspicion of criminal activity were found in the remaining allegations.
PARTICIPATION OF NATIONAL MINORITIES
Interethnic issues are not a prominent factor in the current political crisis.
Members of minority communities and parties representing them, particularly the ethnic Albanians, have been participating in protests across the country, individually, with other communities and as part of the Protestiram movement.
The so-called non-parliamentary bloc of smaller Albanian parties (DPA- Reform, National Democratic Revival and BESA) also joined the demonstrations.
In some areas such as Tetovo, the protest had an inter-ethnic character, with symbols of the country’s flag and of the Albanian and Roma community displayed together.

INTRODUCTION
The Coalition “All for Fair Trials” is a network of 14 civic organisations in which members are local citizen associations for the purpose of monitoring trials before competent courts, in order to: a) ensure the guaranteed rights to fair trial as envisaged in the Constitution, laws and  ratified international agreements; b) increase the public awareness and underline the required reforms and the respective implementation concerning trials; c) enhance the practical knowledge of students of law; and d) strengthen the role and capacity of non-governmental organisations.
Given the current increasing necessity for trial monitoring, in particular concerning the field of criminal law, i.e. criminal procedure, in the course of 2016, the  Coalition, financially supported by the OSCE Mission to Skopje, implemented the project «Enhancing the independence, transparency and efficiency of the judiciary through trial monitoring”, as continuation of trial monitoring activities from the previous year.
It focused on the application of the new Law on Criminal Procedure in all four appellate regions in the country, specifically, in the basic courts, for the purpose of drafting a situational analysis along with recommendations for future activities and reforms, aimed at enhancing the capacities of the judicial system in the country.
METHODOLOGY
Monitors
15 monitors, with several-years long experience in trial monitoring throughout the country, were recruited for the needs of the project and for the preparation of the analysis, resulting from the available data from trial monitoring.
The monitors were required to have a university degree – a degree in law and thorough knowledge of criminal matters in order to be able to identify the most prevalent challenges encountered by the courts and all participants in criminal proceedings, as well as to detect the inadequate, i.e. incomplete implementation of the Law on Criminal Procedure.
Questionnaire
In the process of collecting data from trial monitoring, the monitors were provided with a tool, i.e. a questionnaire, which guided them within the system for processing the initial information and observations that were noted during their presence in the courtrooms.
Specifically, after having initially obtained the overall information from a particular hearing, based on 72 systematically arranged questions in the questionnaire, the monitors entered the collected data to an extent and in a manner that served the needs of the analysis.
The questionnaire itself was designed according to the sequence and manner of conducting criminal proceedings before a competent court, with particular focus on some of the new provisions, that is, introduced novelties in the Law on Criminal Procedure, along with provided tailored space where the personal cognitive perception of the monitors is entered.
GENERAL DATA
The monitoring system in the framework of this project covered the whole territory of the country, that is, the four appellate regions, with special focus on the courts in Skopje (Basic Court Skopje 1), Veles, Bitola, Shtip, Tetovo, Kumanovo and Kochani and targeted 450 court hearings or 372 criminal cases.
The total number of monitored trials included monitoring of 198 hearings or 152 cases in the Basic Court Skopje 1; 33 hearings and equivalent number of cases in the Basic Court Veles, 14 hearings concerning 12 cases in the Basic Court Kumanovo, and 71 hearings resulting from 57 cases in the Basic Court Tetovo, in the Basic Court Bitola, the number of monitored hearings was almost similar to the total number of monitored cases; 29 hearings were monitored concerning 23 cases in the Basic Court Shtip; and finally, the number of monitored hearings in the Basic Court Kochani largely overlapped with the number of cases, i.e. 16 hearings in 15 cases.
The respective statistics is presented in the Table below
Statistics on the number of monitored hearings against the number of cases.
Given the fact that the initial phase of this project overlapped with the beginning of the judicial administration (court clerks) strike, that lasted over half of the period envisaged for trial monitoring, the very dynamics of the monitoring activity was volatile, i.e. varied and reached its highest peaks once the strike ended.
Namely, as shown in the Table, one can note that the last 3 months of the monitoring process entail the largest number of hearings, i.e. September- 85, October- 91 and November- 161 hearings.
However, one can especially note the trend of hearings being held at the Basic Court Skopje 1 during the court administration strike.
Even though the court operation was at stand throughout the country and no hearings were held in most of the courts, i.e. the work was completely blocked; yet, that was not the case at the Basic Court Skopje 1.
In this court, some judges proceeded with work and held the scheduled hearings, and only small part of them demonstrated solidarity with the administration and discontinued the work; however, one should note that this refers to an insignificant number of judges.
Hearings per month
The data collected from the total number of hearings that were subject of monitoring throughout the country show that ⅓ of the hearings or 153 were postponed, 119 were completed in verdict, the indictment was withdrawn in 9 cases, the criminal proceedings were stayed in one hearing, whereas 168 hearings proceeded with procedural acts, as shown on the Chart below.
In realistic terms, this is a striking figure, especially given the fact that the number of postponed hearings in the two biggest appellate regions is clearly higher compared to the other regions.
Statistics on proceedings taken by courts
Based on the data, the postponement of hearings relies on several circumstances which are stipulated both in the Law on Criminal Procedure and beyond the law.
Namely, problems such as improper service of process, and failure of the parties and the witnesses and expert witnesses to appear in court hearings are singled out as topics that require further elaboration in order to advance and improve the system of securing the presence of the participants in the proceedings.
The statistics deriving from analysed data show that the postponement of hearings largely results from the absence of the defendant in the court proceedings – in 97 cases i.e. hearings, or due to the absence of the public prosecutor – 32 cases; absence of the defence attorney - 26 cases and incomplete panel of judges appointed on a specific case - 4 cases, however, one should not overlook the total number of 53 hearings when the postponement relied on “other grounds”.
One of the stated reasons for non-appearance of the defendants during the trial is the failure to bring them from the penitentiary facilities before the court.
In some cases, it results from lack of coordination with the registration system for transfer of detainees, while in other cases it results from technical difficulties (which is necessarily related to finances) for the detainee to be brought before court when the trial is held in cities outside the regions where the penitentiary institutions are located, while in some cases it results from overlapping with certain high profile court cases that practically leads to total blockage and dysfunction of the overall  system in a given court region (in this particular case, the Basic Court Skopje 1).
The legal provisions concerning the failure of the public prosecutor, i.e. private plaintiff to appear before the court clearly stipulate the essential role they have in the proceedings, despite this fact, public prosecutors failed to appear before the court in 32 cases or 32 hearings, which is a high percentage and accounts for 20% of the total number of postponed hearings.
This figure is further augmented by the number of 26 hearings where the defence attorney failed to appear.
This fact relies on the most prevalent reasons that defendants replace their defence attorneys and the concurrent obligations of defence attorneys in other cases, as well as the time required for the defence attorneys to study the facts and evidence of the respective case.
And finally, one reason for postponements under the category “other” refers to the failure of witnesses or expert witnesses to appear in court proceedings, as well as the need to present certain evidence, which is not yet provided or an expert report which is still not drafted.
In the instant case, total of 53 hearings were postponed under the category of reasons «other».
The Table below provides an overview of postponed court hearings by cities and the most frequent reasons thereof.
In view of the foregoing, this is one of the most striking problems that has been persistent in the past years in the judiciary.
The presented overview leads to the conclusion that the number of postponements is proportional to the size of the cities where the monitoring was conducted; hence, all the listed options for postponements in the questionnaire were exhausted in Skopje and Bitola, unlike smaller cities such as Veles and Kochani.
One thing that stands out, as shown in the Table below, is the defendant’s absence as reason for postponement in Skopje and Bitola, along with the absence of the public prosecutor (higher % in Skopje).
Reasons for postponement per city
In view of the monitoring data from the previous year, the data for this year do now indicate an upward trend, but quite the opposite, the statistics for both the previous and this year, shows 86 that  ⅓ of monitored hearings were postponed, which means that it poses a problem that may not be overlooked, but would require the adoption of legal solutions along with preventive mechanisms in order to improve the court proceedings.
Whether that would entail improved cooperation among the judicial authorities and those in charge of bringing detainees before courts, as quite often the absence of the defendant is not a fault on the part of the court, or whether that would mean more consistent application of the legal provisions pertaining to sanctioning the parties that fail to appear in court, such as the public prosecution office in the present case, the necessity for improved solutions has become increasingly obvious.
Based on the data from the conducted monitoring, the crimes committed in 450 hearings out of the total number of monitored hearings, mainly refer to the following chapters: «Crimes against property», «Crimes against life and body» as well as «Crimes against public transport safety».
Most common crimes were “Grand theft” and “Theft” in 60 and 38 of the monitored hearings, respectively, then “Bodily injury” in 40 hearings, “Endangered safety” in 20 hearings as well as “Endangered traffic safety” in 23 and «Severe crimes against the security of people and property in traffic» in 22 of the monitored hearings.
Number of criminal acts
From the total of 450 monitored hearings throughout the year, the monitors registered a number of 815 defendants that appeared in before the court for cases involving only one defendant or several defendants, reaching up to number of 37 defendants in one single case.
Number of hearings
Article 71 and Article 74 of the Law on Criminal Procedure stipulate the right to defence attorney.
According to the law, any individual who is suspected of or charged with a crime shall have the right to a defence attorney throughout the whole criminal procedure taken against him/her.
Prior to the first examination or any other proceedings specified in the  LCP are taken, the defendant shall be advised of his/her right to a defence attorney of his/her choice who can be consulted as well as that the defence attorney can be present during the examination.
However, in cases when the defendant is mute, deaf, or lacks the capacity to successfully defend him/herself or criminal proceeding are undertaken against the defendant for a crime which is punishable with a life sentence according to law, a defence attorney must be present at the very first examination.
According to the law, a defence attorney is necessary when detention is foreseen or imposed, that is, throughout the whole detention period.
In a situation when defence is mandatory and the accused fails to provide his/her defence attorney, the president of the court shall appoint an ex officio defence attorney for the further course of the proceedings, until the verdict becomes effective.
The following statistics derives from the data collected throughout the monitoring process:  276 accused individuals hired their own defence attorneys, 38 accused individuals were appointed an ex officio defence attorney and 108 accused individuals had no defence attorney.
Number of hearings in which the defendant had a defence attorney
Number of hearings in which the defendant had a defence attorney appointed ex-officio
Number of hearings in which the defendant didnot have a defence attorney
The Law on Criminal Procedure prescribes 4 types of summary proceedings:  1) summary proceedings for cases where a fine or imprisonment sentence up to 5 years is imposed, 2) proceedings in which a verdict is reached based on a plea agreement between the public prosecutor and the defendant, including the bargaining on the imposed sanction, 3) mediation proceedings where a specialized third party takes part - mediator, and 4) proceedings for issuing a penal notice proposing and prescribing a certain sanction when sufficient evidence of committed crimes exist, which is under the competence of a trial judge.
Having in mind that the monitors from the Coalition “All For Fair Trials” are allowed to access and attend only proceedings held in the court, i.e. public hearings, in addition to the regular proceedings, there was an opportunity to attend only one of the summary proceedings.
Accordingly, the collected data include 129 held regular proceedings or this accounts for 30% of all monitored hearings and 305 summary proceedings, which accounts for 70% of the hearings held.
Type of proceeding
MAIN TRIAL
Pursuant to the Law on Criminal Procedure, when the judge or the panel ascertains that all individuals required to attend the main trial are present, i.e. whether the trial can be held in the absence of some of the summoned persons, the court instructs the parties at the main trial to make the opening statements.
The process is conducted in successive order, i.e. the plaintiff- public prosecutor is given the opportunity to make the opening statement, followed by the defence attorney, i.e. defendant.
In view of this part of the procedure, once this legal instrument started to apply, the parties are given the opportunity to disclose decisive facts that they intend to prove, to list the evidence that they will present in a later phase and to determine the questions that will be discussed.
However, LCP distinguishes between the acts undertaken by the court and the application of this legal instrument both in regular and summary proceedings.
Namely, in regular proceedings, the above mentioned principle of making an opening statement is a rule, according to which the defence is always entitled not to make an opening statement, in summary proceeding, which cover over 80 % of the court cases, and entail crimes which are punishable with imprisonment sentence of up to 5 years, the opening statements of the public prosecutors transform into presentation of the indictment’s content, whereas the law does not foresee the contribution of the defence in respect of putting forward decisive facts in favour of the defence.
Even though the opening statements are not legally binding in summary proceedings, they are often utilized also by the defence attorneys.
Based on the processed data resulting from this monitoring exercise, there were a total number of 122 opening statements made by the public prosecutor, 59 by the defence attorney and 37 by the defendant.
The Table below shows the application of this legal instrument both in regular and summary proceedings.
One specific aspect that stands out is that in regular proceedings, on several occasions, the defence attorneys exercised their right not to make an opening statement, or specifically in 7 of the monitored cases.
Even though it is not specified for the summary proceedings, in almost 30% of cases, defence attorneys made opening statements, as shown in the graph below.
Opening statements
As part of the questionnaire, the monitors were tasked to assess, based on their individual perception, whether the opening statements disclose the decisive facts that will be further discussed and proved in the proceedings by the respective party making the opening statement.
Accordingly, the following data were obtained: -the public prosecutor’s opening statements were clear in 49% of the hearings, unclear in  23% of the proceedings and in 28% of the hearings the opening statements only partially revealed what was presented and will be proved by the public prosecutor;-the opening statements made by the defence attorney were clear in 77% of the hearings, unclear in 8% of the hearings, whereas 15% of the opening statements only partially revealed the facts that the defence i.e. defence attorney will further prove;-the opening statement made by the defendant was clear in 35% of the hearings, unclear in 6% of the hearings, and 59% of the opening statements only partially revealed the facts given by the defendant.
As a result, the data which were in this way obtained concerning the opening statements, undoubtedly show that defence attorneys make more clear and precise opening statements compared to the public prosecutors, furthermore, the high percentage of partially clear facts and evidence referred to by the defendants are indicative of the need for hiring a professional, that is, a defence attorney, that would represent the defendant’s interests and from the very beginning of the proceedings would portray a clear picture to the court about the intentions to propose evidence and about the case theory that will be elaborated.
Yet, one has to note that some of the opening statements made by the defendants, according to the monitors’ questionnaires, were made in the presence of their defence attorneys.
Furthermore, one must underline the detected inconsistency in the work of public prosecutors from the aspect of reducing the opening statement to a “plain” reading of the indictment, without presenting the theory of the case or the thesis that will be represented, and the way of distinguishing the legal elements that will be discussed in order to prove the grounds of the indictment.
Based on the processed data, the statistics shows that in over 70% of cases where the opening statements were made by the public prosecutor, it was reduced to plain reading of the indictment, rather than a more detailed explanation of what may be derived thereof.
Having made such opening statements, neither the court is clear what will the public prosecutor aim to prove, nor the defence is clear about the prosecutor’s thesis on the substantiation of the indictment or the plan to prove it.
GUILTY PLEA
The monitors attended 95 hearings in which the defendant pleaded guilty.
On this occasion, an analysis is conducted on the data obtained from the monitors regarding the legality of the guilty plea, the role of the court and the parties during the guilty plea process, as well as certain circumstances of guilty plea that concern some specific instruments in the criminal procedure and have immediate impact on the justification and legality of guilty plea.
Therefore, analysis is conducted on the data which refer to imposed detention at hearings when the defendant pleaded guilty, as well as the quantity of presented evidence by the court in determining the type and extent of criminal sanction under conditions of guilty plea during the first hearing of the main trial.
The Table below shows the trend of submission of guilty pleas, that is, out of the total number of 450 monitored hearings and 153 postponed, the monitors attended 95 hearings in which the defendant pleaded guilty.
Compared to the total number of hearings held (168), one can draw the conclusion that data concerning the guilty pleas made by defendants are considered as especially relevant data for drawing conclusions.
Moreover, out of the total number of analysed verdicts – 119, almost 95 verdicts were reached by guilty plea.
Guilty plea and type of criminal proceedings
Based on the obtained data, one can draw the conclusion that the instrument of guilty plea is put in place and has begun to take root in the national system of criminal justice.
Moreover, this instrument is also recognised by the parties in the criminal proceedings as an efficient tool for rapid, efficient and effective completion of criminal proceedings.
An additional argument for the increased application of this instrument may be the data from monitored trials in the previous year when guilty plea was made in 70 cases out of 550 hearings monitored in total, compared to this year, there is an increase of over one third, that is, defendants pleaded guilty at the main trial in 95 cases out of 450 hearings monitored, in total.
However, from the analysis of the basic courts’ annual reports1, the application of guilty plea is not made in the same extent as in the monitored cases, even though one can conclude that this instrument is applied with increased frequency.
Pleading guilty in summary proceedings
In view of the applicability, an additional argument is the fact that based on the analysed data, obtained by the monitors, this instrument is largely applied in summary proceedings, which accounts for around 85% of the cases, or for crimes which are punishable with up to 5 years of imprisonment.
These data support the thesis that courts feel safer to apply this instrument for minor crimes, while considered in correlation with the data obtained from the annual court reports, as well as the data obtained by the trial monitors, one can draw the conclusion that this instrument is not frequently applied for more serious crimes.
The data only confirm that it concerns a new instrument and the courts, understandably, have certain reservation to apply it in relation to more serious crimes.
Concerning the geographical distribution of the guilty plea in relation to the total number of monitored hearings, one can note that guilty plea was registered, in general, in almost one fifth of the monitored hearings, which accounts for 20% of monitored hearings.
Basic Court Skopje 1 and Basic Court Tetovo deviate from this trend.
Thus, one can notice the lowest number of monitored hearings in the Basic Court Skopje in which the defendant pleaded guilty, which accounts for 16% of the total number of monitored hearings, whereas guilty plea  was more frequent at the Basic Court Tetovo, that is,  in one third of monitored cases, which accounts for 38% of all monitored hearings.
Admission of guilt per criminal act
As to the type of crimes to which the defendants were willing to plead guilty, in general, it concerns a wide range of crimes.
If compared to the statistical yearbooks on crime movement, one can draw the conclusion that the defendants were generally willing to plead guilty to all crimes; or in other words, the trend of pleading guilty corresponds to the trend of crimes which are processed before the basic courts.
The majority of guilty pleas refer to crimes against the life and body, prop-erty and public traffic safety.
This is followed by crimes against the official position, sexual morality and sexual freedom.
Based on the data, one can discern the fact that pleading guilty during the main trial does not depend on the type of crime.
Generally, this is a positive conclusion as one cannot detect any selection in the guilty plea in relation to the type of crime.
In this context, an additional conclusion derives from the thesis that the willingness of the defendants to plead guilty depends on the extent to which the case and the criminal incident were investigated by the law enforcement agencies, i.e. the extent to which the indictment was substantiated.
The graphs below concern the analysis of the procedural rules on admissibility and legality of guilty plea.
Pursuant to the obligation deriving from Article 74 of the LCP that a defence attorney must attend when the defendant pleads guilty, the data, obtained from the monitors and further analysed, show that defence attorneys were present in all of the cases.
Were questions posed to check the admission of guilt made by the defendant
Concerning the data related to verification of all elements of a particular crime, one can conclude that when judges reviewed the guilty plea statement, the defendant was largely advised about the charges and what s/he had pleaded guilty for.
Nevertheless, there is a still persistent practice, despite the minimal improvements compared to the previous year (87% against 82%), that judges only read the indictment to the defendant, or provide explanation about the process of determining the type  and extent of criminal sanction, according to the provisions of the Law on Determining the Type and Extent of Criminal Sanction.
Therefore, one can draw the conclusion that the judges should dedicate more attention to the defendant as well as his/her defence attorney, with regard to the request for providing adequate legal aid to their clients; in the explanation about the legal elements of the crime; the prosecutorial evidence to corroborate the legal elements of the crime; and the manner of commission of the respective crime.
The court should be entirely convinced that the defendant had committed the respective crime as provided in the indictment; that is, the specific crime to which the defendant pleaded guilty in the course of the main trial.
It is therefore considered inadmissible that the court has adopted a practice to read the indictment or as entered in one of the monitors’ questionnaires - the defendant pleaded guilty, but the respective crime had not been committed as presented in the indictment.
Any such opposing by the defendant or correction made by the defendant concerning the indictment during the pleading of guilt should not have been accepted by the court as a voluntary admission of guilt for a given crime, as stated in the indictment and the court should have dismissed it and proceeded with the main trial as if no guilty plea had been made, pursuant to the provisions in Articles 381 and 334 of the LCP.
Were questions posed to check whether the defendant madethe admission of guilt of his/her own free will?
An interesting fact is that in 13% of the monitored hearings, where the defendant pleaded guilty, the monitors could note some inconsistency as regards the free will to plead guilty.
That is, in 11 cases, the defendant did not plead guilty of own free will or he/she had certain reservations; however, the court failed to take those reservations into account and accepted such flawed guilty plea.
Needless to say that such practice adopted by the court should be eradicated, especially in respect of the court›s role in the plea hearing or plea bargaining proceedings, as it assumes the role of guarantor and protector of the defendant’s rights.
Such practice stimulates the wrongful application of the guilty plea, and shows tolerance for the tactics of the authorised plaintiff to find a scapegoat with the aim to complete the processing of the cases through the court labyrinths, but failing to take account of either the real perpetrator of the crime, or the safeguards of justice.
Were questions posed to check the defendant’s awarenessof the consequences from the admission of guilt?
The same is the percentage of cases where the monitors took note of the lack of awareness on the part of the defendant regarding the admission of guilt.
The monitors detected cases where the court failed to pay any attention to the opposing on the part of the defendant during the guilty plea, which can lead to the conclusion that such admission of guilt was extorted.
The monitors provided interesting data that in one particular case, the court directly advised the defendant to plead guilty so that the public prosecution avoids to file an indictment against an older close relative, on whose behalf the electricity meter was recorded, concerning a case in which the defendant was charged with the crime – theft of electricity, pursuant to Article 235-a of the Criminal Code.
In these cases, instead of acting in the interest of justice and showing impartiality, the judges had predetermined position in relation to the defendant›s guilt, irrespective of his defence and failed to take into account the presumption of innocence of the defendant.
Despite the slight improvements compared to the previous year, it is of major concern that there are persistent cases in which the court, instead of being a passive arbitrator in assessing the defendant’s free will and awareness about the admission of guilt, the court still actively represents the interests of one of the parties, which is also contrary to the interests of the justice.
In this context, one can arrive at the conclusion about the need to provide additional training for judges, concerning the proactive protection of justice under conditions of admission of guilt during the main trial that is, increasing their active role in the process of assessing the admission of guilt.
This role brings it closer to the role of the court within the mixed criminal proceedings.
In other words, in order to determine whether the defendant made a guilty plea of one’s own will and with full awareness about any consequences thereof, the court can and should be active, as well as inquisitive in assessing the admission of guilt, in such a manner as requesting additional evidence or statements from the defendant in order to ensure complete disclosure and clarification of the criminal event and be fully convinced that the defendant committed the admitted crime.
Was there any evidence presented after the admission of guilt?
Finally, apart from examining the awareness and free will under which the admission of guilt is made, the court is to assess whether the guilty plea is corroborated by evidence.
Accordingly, Article 381, paragraph 3 of the LCP stipulates the court’s obligation to verify whether the admission of guilt is supported by evidence, i.e. during the main trial, the court shall only present evidence that leads to determining the type and extent of criminal sanction.
Based on the data obtained by the monitors, one may conclude that the specific part of the proceedings aimed to assess the defendant’s admission of guilt is most “vulnerable” in view of prevention of any false testimonies.
Based on the data, it is obvious that the court presents insufficient corroborating evidence for the admission of guilt, and the verdict is largely based on the statement, i.e. the admission of guilt by the defendant.
The monitors noted that only in nine hearings there was corroborating evidence presented concerning the determination of the type and extent of criminal sanction.
Moreover, an additional problem lies in the fact that in one half of these hearings, i.e. five of them, the only evidence presented by the court was the defendant’s prior conviction.
Therefore, it is needless to elaborate how questionable is the prior conviction as prima facie evidence.
This is for the simple reason that recidivism, i.e. prior conviction, itself cannot suffice as ground to determine the criminal life style of an individual.
Any prior conviction should be analysed from the aspect of the type of crime and the respective conviction, the time elapsed from the prior conviction until the admission of guilt, and the respective life style of the defendant.
It is considered impossible to determine a more severe penalty by applying a simple mathematical operation and calculate the prior convic-tion as nine points5.
Having regard to the presented data, one can arrive at the conclusion about the necessity of having the court to undertake an active role during the evidentiary hearing; that is, to be authorised to request the parties to provide evidence of appropriate quantity and quality, in order to accept the admission of guilt as righteous and fair, and determine the adequate sanction accordingly.
The reasons why evidence is presented in this manner cannot be identified only with the role of the court, but also with some inconsistencies in the LCP.
According to the LCP, evidence is proposed by the parties, and following the defendant’s guilty plea, the court has insight only in the list of evidence that will be presented during the evidentiary hearing in support of the indictment (Article 321, paragraph 2 of the Law on Criminal Procedure - LCP).
The court, therefore, has no knowledge in advance whether any of the listed evidence may be in favour of the guilty plea and to which extent the respective evidence can contribute to the determination of the type and extent of sanction.
Moreover, there is a prevailing dilemma, whether any of the parties would be interested in complete disclosure of the evidence through the extensive methods of direct and cross examination of witnesses under conditions when the defendant pleaded guilty.
Accordingly, the LCP would require certain reforms, in the context of modification of the previsions that regulate the main hearing, in such a manner that would accept the “originary” solution from the American criminal justice system that is, holding a separate sentencing hearing.
Such a hearing would eliminate the dilemmas which the local courts are confronted with, due to the existing provisions of the LCP which fail to provide efficient means for presenting evidence in support of the guilty plea and determining the most appropriate sanction, therefore, the court relies only on very simple evidence, that is, prior conviction records, and also relies on the already questionable6 provisions of the Law on Determining the Type and Extent of Criminal Sanction.
In respect of the question “Did the defence attorney have enough time to advise the defendant?”, the monitors had the possibility to make an assessment only in one third of monitored hearings in which the defendant pleaded guilty.
Based on the data from 31 answers, the monitors noted that in 94% of the cases that the defendant had enough time to consult  his/her defence attorney, whereas in 6% it was noted that the defendant did not consult his/her defence attorney or he had no sufficient time to consult his/her defence attorney.
Nevertheless, one cannot consider these data as problematic for a simple reason - if the defendant already had a defence attorney during the previous phases of the criminal proceedings, one can expect that the guilty plea had been already agreed upon and elaborated with his/her defence attorney.
This practice would become problematic in cases in which the defendant had no defence attorney, then decided to plead guilty, and only then hired an attorney or was appointed an ex officio attorney by the court.
In such cases, it is considered necessary that the court provides sufficient time to the defendant and the defence attorney, in order to enable the defence attorney to explain any consequences of the guilty plea to his/her client.
Moreover, if such remarks relate to this risky group in 6% of the hearings, any such practice of the court needs to be eradicated and should not be tolerated by any of the parties, irrespective of the fact that the acceptance of the defendant’s guilty plea by the court is in favour both of the defendant and his/her defence attorney, as well as the public prosecutor.
Such a practice is unlawful and contrary to the interests of justice.
DETENTION AND MEASURES FOR SECURING ATTENDANCE
Article 144 of the Law on Criminal Procedure provides the following measures for securing attendance: summons, precautionary measures, bail, arrest, deprivation of liberty, retention, short detention, home detention and detention.
In respect of the range of these measures, the monitors attended only 34 hearings in which the defendants were in detention (see table below), while milder measures for securing the attendance of defendants were applied in only 14 cases.
Based on the obtained data, there is a noticeable tendency for non-excessive use of detention by the court in the analysed and recorded cases by the monitors, or the measure of detention was applied in about 8% of the monitored cases.
However, having in mind the type of crimes for which the hearings were subject to monitoring, one can conclude that detention is not imposed only in small and insignificant percentage, compared to the other hearings.
There is a concern, as noted by the monitors, about the persistent practice of the courts not to provide appropriate explanation on the reasons to impose the measure of detention, or to provide realistic assessment of the underlying factors and register them in writing in the decision to continue the detention7.
In addition to imposing the detention measure, the monitors noted that milder measures for securing the attendance of defendants were applied by the court in only 26 cases (see the table below).
The monitors noted that these measures were imposed on the defendants in 14 cases; in two cases the measures were imposed on the other participants in the criminal proceedings, that is, the damaged party and the witness were forcibly brought on one occasion, whereas the milder measure - summons - was applied in the remaining 10 cases.
According to these data, it is inevitable to conclude that the court fails to take into account the alternatives to the most severe measure – detention - as the efficiency of such measures is already recognised in other more developed criminal justice systems.
In this context, the milder measures remain to be only a matter of normative style in our LCP, which are applied very rarely or not applied at all.
Regretfully, the same is true about the following measures: bail, home detention and most of the precautionary measures.
Accordingly, one needs to note the arguments for overlooking these measures, namely, there is lack of adequate mechanism for their application and control; the court does not dispose of appropriate tools that would provide convincing data that if applied, there will be sufficient guarantee that the defendant’s presence will be secured during the main hearings and that their application would exclude or reduce the risks for which the measures were applied.
Therefore, it is recommended that mechanisms for institutional support of the court need to be developed in order to ensure the application of milder measures that secure the attendance of the defendant in the course of criminal proceedings.
In this respect, such mechanisms are primarily seen from the aspect of developing the capacities of the Probation Services, which are established in accordance with the Law on Probation; introduction of changes and amendments to the Law on Probation that would incorporate the respective measures as competence of the probation services; as well as application of the LCP by imposing an ex officio obligation to the probation services to deliver the respective data to the court and generate risk assessments concerning the defendant, that would serve as ground on which the court would decide about the application of the most appropriate measure for securing the attendance of the defendant.
Finally, having regard to these recommendations, the court would be enabled to provide true and based on fact rationale in the decision to apply the measures for securing attendance.
In respect of assessing the legality of the procedure to apply these measures, one can conclude that apart from one case, the requirements of the LCP referring to the presence of the defence attorney when the measure of detention is imposed, were properly applied in all other cases.
Detention-without a defence attorney
On the other hand, based on the monitors’ analysis, one can commend the practice of the court (see the graph below) for having entirely fulfilled the procedural provisions on the obligatory attendance of a defence attorney under conditions when the detained person admitted the guilt.
Admission of guilt made with a defence attorney-detention
The observed practice of the court to fail to act in line with Article 173 of LCP is problematic, that is, according to this Article, detention is to be discontinued following the admission of guilt,  in cases when it had been imposed under conditions of existent justified risk that the defendant will hide, falsify or destroy the traces of the crime; or if there are special circumstances indicating that the defendant will obstruct the criminal proceedings by tempering with witnesses, expert witnesses, accomplices or those covering up criminal acts.
Or, despite the insignificant number of observed violations when the court acted contrary to the LCP in two of four noted cases, or specifically, it failed to discontinue the measure of detention once the defendant admitted the guilt, yet, any such cases require to be further analysed.
This is for a simple reason that being driven by the iura novit curia  principle, one can draw the conclusion that most probably detention in such cases was imposed on several grounds, and there was rational expectation on the part of the court that the other grounds for continuation of the measure of detention would persist, even though the defendant pleaded guilty.
However, despite of having accepted this argument, and as noted in this report, the existing problem still persists in respect of the factually instituted decisions to impose detention, that is, the frequent, uncritical and unsubstantiated imposing of detention on several grounds from Article 165 of LCP, as well as the noted problem concerning the rationale in the decisions to impose detention based on (in)appropriate facts and evidence, which also implies their (in)appropriate registration in the respective decisions.
Was the detention discontinued after making admission of guilt
Any other explanation concerning the monitors’ allegations would lead to the conclusion that the foregoing Roman legal principle is denied, which would further result in wrongful application of the LCP provisions.
Moreover, had the court taken this position in such cases, defence attorneys as well as public prosecutors, who are the guardians of legality, should not have tolerated any such action, i.e. it should have been challenged in appeal proceedings for a simple reason that such cases endanger the fundamental human right – right to liberty.
EVIDENTIARY PROCEEDINGS
The evidentiary proceeding, as part of the main hearing, is stipulated within the scope of Articles 382 to 394 of the LCP, and as such it is given a consecutive order in the law, as well as in the systematically arranged questionnaire of the Coalition, that is, after the defendant is advised about his/her rights and the option to plead guilty during the hearing.
There is a clearly prescribed order of presenting the evidence in this part of the proceedings.
Specifically, the first to be presented are the evidence related to the indictment and any property claims, followed by the evidence of the defence and possible prosecutorial evidence that would challenge any of the evidence presented by the defence, in the form of evidence in rebuttal, as well as the evidence of the defence in response to the such challenging, in the form of evidence in reply.
The Law on Criminal Procedure specifies 3 ways of examination - direct examination, cross-examination and re-direct and re-cross examination.
Direct examination is undertaken by the party that proposed the witness, the expert witness or the technical advisor; cross-examination is undertaken by the opposing party, whereas any additional examination is repeated by the party who called the witness or the expert witness, so that any questions posed during this examination are limited to the questions posed during the examination of the opposing party.
After the parties complete their examination, the chair of the judicial panel (and its members) may ask questions.
During the evidentiary proceedings, the role of the court is to exercise control over the manner and order of examining witnesses and expert witnesses as well as the presenting of evidence, and accordingly takes into account the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proceedings and the determination of truth.
In this part of the proceedings,  the court also  decides about any objections raised by the parties, whereby it can ban a certain question or answer to a question which had already been posed or if that is considered inadmissible or irrelevant for the case, or the respective question entails both the question and the answer, indeed, cross-examination is considered as an exception.
The data collected by the monitors show that there is strict adherence to the legal provisions in this respect, and only minimal exception of 1% was registered; that is, the monitors registered inconsistences in the legally prescribed order of presenting evidence in only 2 cases, which was explained on the ground of ensuring the cost-effectiveness of the proceeding.
However, what is being perceived as cost-effectiveness on the part of the court (in the respective 2 cases), in fact, entails the violation of the defendant’s rights which are specified in the LCP.
Was the order of presenting evidence in accordancewith the legally prescribed order?
One novelty that was introduced in the LCP and is currently being applied, refers to the application of paragraph 2 of Article 386, according to which the witness should take an oath before giving a testimony.
One should underline the fact that even though taking an oath is prescribed by law, the court is obliged to warn the witness about his/her duty to inform the court on any matters related to the case to the best of his/her knowledge, and advise the witness that any false testimony is a considered a serious offence.
Based on the available data, the novelty in the law is applied to a satisfactory extent by the court - 69%, however, irrespective of whether an oath was taken or not, the person who testifies may be held criminally responsible for giving false statements in the capacity of a witness and this may be the reason why such obligation is seen as non-obligatory.
In view of the LCP application, and especially the application of the introduced novelties, during the period of vacatio legis as well as once the LCP started to apply, numerous training were organized by the OSCE Mission to Skopje, the American Bar Association in cooperation with the Academy for Judges and Public Prosecutors and the Bar Association, yet, one can note the need for additional professional development of all actors in the proceedings.
In particular, this refers to the application of the provisions related to direct examination, cross-examination and re-cross and re-direct examination of witnesses which is due to the fact that the actors in the proceedings have not yet mastered the techniques which are required to apply the respective legal provisions.
The foregoing conclusion derives from the data collected in respect of the examination of witnesses.
The questions that were designed and included in the questionnaire and were used by the  monitors as  tool for sharing the experiences and the findings obtained in the court, also included a set of questions that precisely refer to the manner and techniques for different types of examination.
The questions entail the aspects of clarity, lack of ambiguity, the extent to which the parties in the proceedings have studied and become familiar with the case, as well as the technical rules that the court and the parties are to respect during the proceedings.
In respect of the part “Were the questions clear and precise during the direct examination of the witness or expert witness?”, the following data were obtained from 126 hearings in which direct examination was applied:
In respect of the question whether the party, who called the witness, left an impression of knowing what he/she was asking and can properly handle the case, we found that irrespective of whether the public prosecutor or the defence called the witness, both parties made the impression that they knew what they were asking and that they handled the case well, which can be seen in the graphs below.
Direct examination undertaken by
As to the court›s activity in the process of presenting evidence, it is stipulated that the role of the court is to exercise control over the manner and order of examining the witnesses, expert witnesses and the presentation of evidence, and accordingly the court takes into account the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the proceedings, and the determination of truth, when necessary, but also takes care about the dignity of the parties and witnesses in the proceedings.
During the proceedings, the court can ban a certain question or answer which had already been answered, or if the question is considered as inadmissible or irrelevant; the court may also reject that certain evidence is presented if considered as unnecessary and of no relevance for the case, however; under no circumstances after the cross-examination, the court may not prevent the opposing party to cross-examine the witness.
This type of violation was observed in only 2% of the processed data.
As regards the cross-examination, the data indicate the necessity for further improvements by all actors in the proceedings.
Cross-examination is stipulated to be limited and to entail only questions that were previously asked by the party that proposed the witness.
Deviation from 106 this rule, which is stipulated in the LCP, was noticed in 18% of the monitored cases.
Specifically, in 88 hearings involving cross-examination, in 72 of them, which accounts for 82%, the cross-examination was limited to questions from the direct examination; however, this was not true in the remaining 18%.
There were registered cases when the judge directly reacted to questions which deviate from the concept of cross-examination, even though it is still questionable whether the judge has the right to ban a particular question without properly raised objection by the party in the proceedings.
In other cases, the parties failed to raise objections on the questions, and therefore they were subject of further explanation and reply.
Based on the collected data, it is a striking fact that the mechanism of cross-examination is more utilized by the defence attorneys than the prosecutors.
As shown in the graphs below (the horizontal line on the bottom of the graph shows the number of defendants in the proceeding), total of 64 persons were cross-examined by the public prosecution, and 104 persons were cross-examined by the defence attorneys.
The data lead to the conclusion that defence attorneys show more determination to utilize the available resources in order to put forward their defence strategy and prove the theory of the case in the interest of the defendants.
Another indicator of the need for improved application of the mechanism- cross-examination by the parties, relies on the fact that no closed questions were used in 31% of cross-examinations.
Furthermore, some interruptions were registered during the cross-examination, that is, 31% of the examination was not performed in a smooth and uninterrupted manner.
On the other hand, according to the monitors’ perception, the cross-examination was successful in 80% of cases.
With regard to the use of objections as tactical mechanism to defend one’s own strategy in a particular case, one can conclude that practically there is equal utilization of this mechanism by both the prosecution office and the defence.
However, if compared to the statistics from the analysis for the previous year when the use of objections by the public prosecution accounted for 22% of the cases and 11% on the part of the defence, this year there is a slight downward trend concerning the public prosecution office and upward trend concerning the defence.
That is, the public prosecution office used objections in 20% of hearings, whereas the defence used objections in 15% of hearings, which, in fact, implies that the utilization of this mechanism is brought closer.
Use of objections in the course of the proceeding
As previously mentioned, the possibility for the court to ask questions in order to clarify certain facts and inconsistencies in the statements is not completely removed, but one has to bear in mind the old Law on Criminal Procedure where such possibility was an exclusive right of the court; that is, it was the court that asked questions, while the parties could pose questions once the examination was completed in order to establish some missing facts.
The court is now given the possibility to pose questions as soon as both parties in the proceeding have completed their examinations; however, such possibility should not be transformed into a separate examination.
The graph below enables us to analyse the possibility for the court to pose questions, which illustrates that the court has been largely utilizing the additional mechanism for posing questions, i.e. in 48 of the monitored proceedings, which accounts for 42% of all monitored proceedings.
Does the court exercise its right to pose questions to the witness/expert?
Some questionnaires include that judges have shifted this possibility into an entirely separate examination of witnesses/experts.
Obviously, the old habits which were deeply rooted in the previous system are being still applied, despite the diametrical changes of the overall system of court proceed-ings.
With respect to Article 388, paragraph 2 of LCP, i.e. exception to direct presentation of evidence, according to which the statements made by witnesses during the investigation  and the statements collected by action of the defence  during the investigation,  can be used in cross-examination or to challenge the presented findings or as evidence in rebuttal, for the purpose of evaluating the authen-ticity of the statements given during the main hearing,  the monitors found that this exception was not 108 largely  applied.
However, for certain percentage or  18% of cases where this exception was applied, this was undertaken due to inconsistent statements or due to reminding the witness about already giv-en statement in order to discredit the witness, that is, when the statement given in direct examination deviated from the previously given statement.
In addition, in lower percentage of the hearings, i.e. 8% of the monitored hearings, the public prosecutor gave a proposal for reading the statement that the witness or the defendant made in a preliminary procedure.
With regard to the examination of the defendant in the proceedings, one has to underline that in accordance with Article 391, paragraph 1 of the LCP, the defendant shall be examined on the proposal of the defence.
The introduction of this provision in the law means complete aban-doning of the principle for automatic examination of the defendant only based on the need of the prosecution office to prove the indictment.
Having abandoned this system of  examination, now the defendant is enabled not to be examined in the proceedings, but rather it  relies on the disposition of the defence, which is contrary to the previous provisions according to which the defendant should have used the right to remain silent in a situation when s/he considers that no statement should be made, which in return creates a different image of the defendant, most often that s/he is guilty and early conclusions are reached by the court both for the defendant and his/her actions.
When the defence makes a proposal that the defendant should be examined, the exam-ination during the hearing is carried out according to the applicable rules which are valid for examination of witnesses, i.e. expert witnesses with respect to particular types of examinations, whereby the defendant may not refuse to answer any questions that are posed according to the concept for cross-examination.
The statistics obtained from the data collected this year, shows that in 65% of the monitored hearings the defendant was examined, which is an upward trend compared to the data from pre-vious years, that is, 53% in 2015 and 50% in 2014, respectively.
FAIR TRIAL – equality of arms
With respect to the evaluation of the equality of arms between the parties, one can conclude that the monitors preserved the same position as in the previous years.
On the question “Were the parties equally treated by the court and whether the defence was given the same opportunities as the public prosecution office in the process of proposing evidence?” the monitors provided high percentage of affirmative answers - 99%.
According to the answers, the monitors provided negative answers in only three, i.e. two cases, as illustrated on the graph below.
Were the defence and the public prosecutor equally treated by the court?
In this context, one can conclude that during the main hearing, when the parties are afforded the possibility to oppose before the court, the court largely equally treats the parties, that is, gives them equal opportunity to propose evidence.
In addition, the identified remarks in the sense of restricting the right to equality of arms, most probably derive from the unequal opportunities given to the parties, primarily in the course of the preliminary proceedings, that is, when evidence is collected, so by analogy, if the parties are not able to collect certain evidence during the investigation, there is no possibility to propose that such evidence is presented during the main hearing.
In fact, in this way, the problems related to the equality of arms between the parties, which is part of the fair trial principle, can be possibly disguised if the analysis is made only from the aspect of the role of the court in the course of the main hearing.
Was the defence given the same opportunities as the publicprosecution office in respect of proposing evidence?
Public trial right/principle
With regard to the publicity, as one of the fundamental principles of court proceedings, one can conclude that any significant inconsistencies in the application of provisions of the LCP were not noticed by the monitors.
Also, the monitors concluded that in cases where the public was excluded, that was undertaken in compliance with the provisions of the LCP.
One interesting fact in terms of protecting the right to public trials is the obvious inactivity when it comes to having publicly announced the time and cases brought before the courts.
As this matter is concerned, one can notice a constant downturn, compared to the previous year, when the time and the place of the trials were not announced before the courtroom in only 12% of the monitored cases, this year, the trend is further enhanced and accounts for almost 20% of the analysed cases.
The reasons for such weakening of the right of the public to be informed about the place and time of court proceedings in the court buildings can be identified with the poor maintenance of the notice boards in the courts; there is poor planning about the regular maintenance of the notification systems in the Judicial budget or the court administration units lack adequate understanding of the relevance of timely notification about action taken before the court, so that they overlook the obligation during the ongoing exercising of the judicial competencies.
Were the place and time of the trial publically announcedon the notice board outside the courtroom?
Impartiality right/principle
The principle of court’s impartiality is one of the essential principles as part of the right to fair trial and fair proceedings.
The analysis whether this principle is protected in the court proceedings was based on a set of questions concerning the judicial disqualification, which is, in fact, one mechanisms under conditions when the partiality of the court towards some of the parties is recognized.
Throughout the monitoring, the monitors did not witness any cases when the parties requested the judge to be disqualified.
The data lead to the conclusion that the court adequately applied and gave due attention to the provisions of the LCP, which stipulate when a judge must be disqualified, as well as that the court appropriately conducted the proceedings without any grounds for suspicion of its partiality, which can be a ground for optional disqualification of judges (recusal).
Interestingly enough, in seven proceedings the monitors noted that the judges had already formed opinion with regard to the case.
In particular, the data show that these figures are continuously on the increase in the last three years, that is, from only two registered cases two years ago, it increased to five cases last year and finally, seven registered cases in this year.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that this is usually the case when the defendant had already pleaded guilty.
Despite the insignificant number of such registered case, i.e. seven hearings out of total of 450 monitored hearings, yet, such practice poses a certain concern because instead of having the court actively assess the guilty plea, there is a situation where the court hardly waits for the admission in order to have its position towards the defendant verified.
Moreover, such cases would also require that the role of the defence attorney is re-evaluated, i.e. whether and how was the client advised about the admission of guilt.
When the court has taken such a role, the overall guarantee and safeguard mechanisms of the courts’ image become highly questionable.
One possibility to abandon this situation is the prospective future reform of the LCP provisions by introduction of a special sentencing hearing, and in such case some additional evidence will have to be presented before the court that would confirm the guilt on the part of the defendant, which was previously discerned by the court through the defendant’s admission of guilt.
Based on the data, one can conclude that the court was biased in five cases, whereas the defendant was intimidated in two cases.
Such intimidation, as was additionally explained by the monitors, was detected through the way in which the court, while explaining the provisions of the Law on Determining the Type and Extent of Criminal Sanction, used wording that stimulated the defendant’s admission of guilt and put strong emphasis on the fact that admission of guilt implies a milder sanction as opposed to the having held the main hearing which would result in more severe sanction.
In such cases, one can consider it probable that the court delivered inappropriate wording for the purpose of somehow assisting the defendant, while giving explanation about the consequences from the admission of guilt.
Yet, such practice of the courts should be minimized and eliminated through appropriate training of judges.
In order to avoid the practice of the court to give indications about the consequences from the admission of guilt, which may be further interpreted both by the defendant or other actors in the proceedings that the court is in favour of the admission of guilt.
In this way, the admission of guilt would only result from the free will of the defendant and would be void of any burdens from initiatives or subtle pressures on the part of the court.
As far as the additional training for judges is concerned, a particular accent should be put on training the judges about the communication of the court with the clients, given the fact that improper ex-parte communication can largely create an impression about the (im)partiality of the court both for the defendant and the general public.
Such impression was created based on the 112 fact that the monitors registered this practice in 12 hearings, which implies a significant increase, compared to the previous year, when such communication was registered in only 5 cases.
Was there improper ex-parte communication?
The reasons for the necessity of additional trainings for judges rely on the fact that under conditions of improper ex-parte communication, the court runs the risk to be recognized as closer to some of the parties, whereby the general public no longer has impression that the court is impartial.
Also, sometimes defence attorneys make an attempt and/or abuse the improper communication with the court so as to present themselves before the clients as having close relations/contacts with the judges, and justify the promises that they  had made to the clients, even though not always realistic, regarding the outcome of the criminal proceedings.
Presumption of innocence
Presumption of innocence is closely related to matters of partiality and all other previously analysed aspects.
This year, unlike the previous year, the situation has deteriorated when viewed from the aspect of the data observed by the monitors.
The monitors registered that the defendant’s right to presumption of innocence was violated in eight cases, which accounts for 3%, and there is a triple increase compared to the previous year when it accounted for only 1% of the cases11.
Was there anything suggesting that the principle of presumptionof innocence was not respected?
This conclusion, viewed in relation to other data on the court’s impartiality, where the mon-itors found that the court was biased in seven cases, and the defendant’s right to presumption of innocence was violated in eight cases, can point to the conclusion that in all of the registered cases, the court was biased to the detriment of the defendant.
No comments are needed in terms of which would be the effects deriving from this conclusion.
Therefore, it is deemed necessary that additional training is delivered for the judges with respect to their role in assessing the defendant’s admission of guilt during the court proceedings.
However, a dose of optimism is instilled by the low number of registered cases, which is why one can conclude that this is not a widespread phenomenon among the judges and therefore, it can be easily thwarted and eliminated.
Right to defence
The right to defence was analysed in a set of questions, mainly in respect of advising the defendant about his/her rights, defence attorneys’ efficiency to realise the theory of the case during the main hearing, the access of the defence to the overall evidence, the appropriate time for preparation, and possible restrictions on this right or/and restrictions on the right of the defendants held in detention to communicate with their defence attorneys.
As to the efficiency of the right to defence, our monitors noted that in 19 cases, which accounts for 12% of the answers to the question, defence attorneys were not equal to the task in terms of ensuring efficient and professional defence to their clients.
In that context, even though it concerns a low percentage from the total number of monitored cases, it is deemed our duty to note that defence attorneys, and the Bar as a professional organisation, are obliged to ensure continuous education and development of the professional standards for the members.
Therefore, there will be a need to provide analysis on continuous basis concerning the efficiency and professionalism of the defence attorneys12 , in particular, under conditions when the adversarial system is put in place, and when their professionalism becomes especially apparent during the main hearing, while the outcome of the criminal proceedings largely depends on the defence.
This fact is supported by an additional argument, which poses a concern, that compared to the previous year there is an upward trend, that is from 6%13 to 12% in the analysed completed questionnaires.
Furthermore, our primary consideration refers to the appropriate formulation of the case theory of the defence, the proposing of appropriate evidence, and the active role of the defence to challenge the prosecutorial evidence by cross-examination and the practice of raising objections to the court so that prosecutor’s questions during the witness testimony are overruled by the court.
Regarding the efficiency of the defence, the defence attorneys, in a defensive manner, often put forward arguments based on the lack of sufficient time to prepare their own defence or that they were confronted with certain restrictions in the contact with their clients.
Such inconsistencies were registered in four cases.
With regard to the problems that defence attorneys face in the provision of effective and efficient defence to their clients, traditionally, they claim that they have restricted access to all the evidence available to the public prosecution office (in 6 cases); that the prosecution fails to deliver the evidence to the defence (in 3 cases); and in other 5 cases in which defence attorneys were denied this right.
One can notice that this year, there is drastic increase in the number of complaints from defence attorneys, that is, from two registered case in the previous year, up to fourteen registered cases this year, or a sevenfold increase.
Were there reactions on the part of the defence because
Accordingly, this can be understood that the desired objectives of the criminal procedure reform15  , put in place through the adoption of the LCP in 2013, have not appropriately echoed in practice; and by making an analogy, one should consider certain modifications of the LCP provisions that would incorporate the safeguard mechanisms for the defence attorneys, so that the obligation to allow the defence attorneys access to all prosecutorial evidence would be enhanced.
This can be made feasible through introduction of a ban to present evidence which was not delivered to the defence and is deemed detrimental to the defendant, or through introduction of an obligation to present evidence which is beneficial for the defence, but the defence claims that even though the public prosecution office is in possession of that evidence, yet it was not delivered to the defence.
Also, the practice of giving limited access of the defence to certain evidence should be prohibited, because no copying, recording or transcripts are allowed.
This refers to cases when the evidence is presented to the defence only in the premises of the public prosecution office, with no possibility for the defence attorney to copy or make transcripts of the evidence, or this activity is further burdened with inappropriately high costs for copying or electronic multiplication on another electronic device for data transfer.
Also, it is considered essential that deadlines, specified in the law, need to be changed and extended - according to which the defendant and defence attorney during the investigation have the right to submit certain documents, evidence or request the public prosecutor to undertake certain investigation and secure certain evidence, in respect of paragraph 4 of Article 302 of LCP, as well as that special deadline should be determined for the main hearing, meaning that the defendant and his/her defence attorney would have sufficient time to prepare the defence concerning the newly obtained evidence by the public prosecution office.
PRONOUNCING AND ANNOUNCING THE VERDIT
Once all the evidence is presented, namely, the evidentiary and main hearings are completed, according to the LCP, the provisions referring to the verdict are successively applied.
Three types of verdicts are stipulated in our Law on Criminal Procedure: rejecting – meaning that the indictment was rejected, not guilty – meaning that the defendant was acquitted, and guilty – meaning that the defendant was convicted/found guilty.
The trial monitors from the Coalition “All for Fair Trials” did not detect any rejecting and not-guilty verdicts; however, they came across situations when the indictment was withdrawn by the public prosecutor in the course of the proceeding.
The indictment was withdrawn in 9 of the monitored cases, that is, in 3 cases where the crime “Bodily Injury” was the ground for prosecu-tion, in 2 cases “Grand Theft” and the remaining for the following crimes “Coercion”, “Endangered Safety”, “Severe Crimes against the Safety of  People and Property in Traffic” and “Providing Public Transport Services without License”.
Indictments withdrawn based on the type of crime
According to the provisions of the LCP, once the verdict is pronounced, it must be immediately announced in public, when the court is not able to pronounce the verdict the same day after the completion of the main hearing, the announcement of the verdict may be delayed for a period not longer than 3 days.
It is stipulated that the court announces the verdict (chair of the judicial panel or sole judge) in the presence of the parties, their legal representatives, proxies, defence attorneys, by publically reading the enacting part of the verdict and stating the reasoning thereof.
In a brief explanation, the court makes reference to the criminal act the defendant «is charged with» and already convicted for (with the verdict), as well as to the evidence presented.
According to the processed monitoring data, it is shown that the verdict was publically an-nounced in 74% of cases, unlike in 26% of the cases when the verdict was not publically announced, also, the data show that when the verdict was pronounced at the hearing, in 41 cases or hearings the court made reference to the criminal act and the evidence, in 3 cases it made a partial reference, whereas in 9 hearings the court made no reference at all.
Compared to the statistics obtained for the needs of similar analysis in the previous year, one can note an upward trend in the percentage of verdicts that were not publically pronounced and announced.
Specifically, based on the data from the previous year, the court publically announced the verdict in 88% of cases and in 12% of cases the court failed to do so.
But, it I worth noting the fact that in accordance with Article 406 of the LCP, as soon as the verdict is announced, the chair of the judicial panel or the sole trial judge shall advice the parties on the right to appeal as well as the right to respond to the appeal.
When a suspended sentence is pronounced, the court has the obligation to warn about the meaning of the suspended sentence and the conditions that the defendant (now convicted) must fulfil.
Was the defendant provided explanation on the terms of appeal?
As shown in the graph above, in 24% of cases, which equals 15 monitored hearings, the court failed to provide explanation on the terms of the appeal even though the court is under such ob-ligation, irrespective of whether the defendant was present at the main hearing with or without a defence attorney.
In 76% of hearings, which equals 48 monitored hearings, the court acted in com-pliance with the law.
One has to underline that these data would not be considered as striking if there were available data that in most of the cases where the court failed to explain the terms of the appeal, the defendant’s attorney was present and could later provide professional advice to his/her client on the appeal procedure, however, no such data were at disposal, and no further comments can be made.
If one summarizes and compares the data on the number of verdicts (convictions) against the data on the number of verdicts based on admission of guilt, one can arrive at the following conclu-sion, as illustrated in the graph below:
The provision on guilty plea is notably applied in in the course of the proceedings in large number of cases.
The data show a high percentage of admission of guilt during the proceedings, i.e. it accounts for 64% of the total number of monitored cases, against 36% of regular (conviction) verdicts.
Generally, this results from the need and the commitment of the defence attorneys to milder sanctions, given that the admission of guilt implies certain percentage to reduce the sentence, and given the attitudes and perceptions that the courts had established for many years concerning the defendants and the unavoidable possible conviction, so that on this ground defendants are more or less convicted, but still convicted.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS:
Detected problems concerning the improper summoning are still persistent, which further results in failure of the parties, expert witnesses and witnesses to attend court hearings.
Recommendation: It would be necessary that the summoning system for witnesses is further elaborated and improved and an efficient system for electronic service to the parties and experts is introduced, as well as to ensure the active involvement of the Ministry of Interior in providing personal data.
The practice of failing to transfer defendants and detainees from penitentiary institutions poses a problem.
The reasons mainly result from: lack of coordination with the registration system for escorting the transfer of persons deprived of liberty, or lack of financial or transportation means to transfer those persons.
Recommendation: Improved coordination among the respective authorities and improvement of the AKMIS System in order to eliminate the detected problems.
The allocation of budget funds for proper functioning of the courts should be realistic.
In view of the opening statements, there is an established practice of inappropriate formulation and presentation of the respective content; whereby the opening statements are transformed into a plain reading of the indictment, presentation of evidence, putting emphasis on the previous convictions of the defendant, without presentation of the case theory or identification of the legal elements which are to be further debated.
Recommendation: Provision of additional trainings for all participants in the criminal proceed-ings about proper application of the provisions of the LCP that stipulate the opening statements.
The guilty plea as a new instrument is well represented in the national criminal justice system, whereby the application is not dependent on the type of the crime, despite that it is most frequently applied for smaller crimes.
The collected data lead to the conclusion that this instrument is recognised by the parties in the criminal proceedings as an efficient tool for rapid, efficient and effective completion of the criminal proceeding.
Concerning the assessment of the defendant’s guilty plea, it is noted that there is an improper practice by the courts to accept flawed admissions of guilt, that is, situations when the court failed to fully establish whether the defendant made the admission of guilt (guilty plea) knowingly and/or of his/her own will.
Recommendation: Additional training of judges would be necessary in order to ensure proactive protection of justice under conditions when the admission of guilt is made in the course of the main hearing that is, increasing the active role of judges in assessing the admission of guilt.
It was noticed that the courts have adopted an inappropriate practice in their assessment of the admission of guilt that is the courts accept the admission of guilt without it being substantiated by facts.
That is, during the reduced evidentiary hearing, only evidence about previous convictions is presented.
Recommendation: Reform of the Law on Criminal Procedure (LCP) in terms of introducing the authorization for the court to request the parties to present evidence in the proper quantity and quality so that the court can be able to fully accept the defendant’s admission of guilt or introducing provisions on special hearing to determine the type and extent of the sanction.
Rare application of the measures to secure the attendance of the defendant, which can serve as an alternative to the detention, even though the efficiency of such measures has been recognised in other more developed criminal justice systems.
Recommendation:  Introduction  of  adequate  mechanisms  for  application  and  control of milder measures that would enable the court to dispose of sufficient data and guarantees for efficient application of the respective measures.
Such mechanisms may be introduced through changes and amendments to the LCP and the Law on Probation, i.e. to incorporate these measures in the competences of the probation services.
Some inconsistency was noted regarding the legally prescribed order to present evidence, under the explanation that it results from the attempt to ensure the cost-effectiveness of the proceedings.
Recommendation: The provisions of the LCP that stipulate the order in which evidence is presented should be consistently applied.
High percentage of improper application of the provisions of the LCP that stipulate the direct examination, cross-examination and re-cross and re-direct examination of witnesses and expert witnesses was documented, and that this results from inappropriately mastered techniques for examination by the parties to the proceedings.
Recommendation: Additional training of the parties to the criminal proceedings will be required for the purpose of proper application of these provisions.
Unjustified frequent utilization of the court’s authorisation to pose questions once the examination of witnesses/expert witnesses is completed, and an activity of the court which may shift into a special hearing in specific cases.
Recommendation: Reform of the provisions of the LCP in order to ensure that such authorization of the court is eliminated.
Certain  failures  on  the  part  of  the  court  administrative  units  were  noted,  such  as inappropriate announcing of the time and place of court hearings.
Recommendation: Increase the courts’ publicity and transparency by ensuring that the time and place of the court hearings are publicly announced, both on the court’s website and within the court buildings.
Repeatedly noted practice of violating the procedural rights of the defence by restricting the access to evidence or hindering the insight into evidence.
Recommendation: Further improvement of the provisions in the LCP that would eliminate the practice of restricting the access of the defence to the prosecutorial evidence, as well as re-examination of the adopted rules on the costs for insight in the evidence and the transcripts thereof.
An upward trend in the percentage of verdicts which are not publically pronounced and announced.
Recommendation: Consistent application of the provisions from the LCP that stipulate the publicly pronouncing and announcing of verdicts.

Counter-terrorism – policies, laws and strategies developed by state actors and implemented primarily by law enforcement, intelligence agencies, and sometimes the military, aimed at thwarting terrorist plots and dismantling terrorist organizations
“Foreign terrorist fighters” – commonly used to refer to individuals who have travelled from their home states to other states to participate in or support terrorist acts, including in the context of armed conflict, especially in Iraq and Syria, as outlined in UN Security Council Resolution 2178 (2014).
The term is contested because of its breadth, vagueness, and associated human rights issues.
Former violent extremists or “formers” – individuals who have disengaged from a path to violent extremism and radicalization that lead to terrorism and who can have a useful role in raising awareness and communicating credible counternarratives.
Gender perspective – awareness and consideration of differential needs, experiences, and status of women and men based on socio-cultural context.
Intervention programming – programmes that target “at-risk” audiences and seek to intervene in a person’s pathway to terrorist radicalization before the line of criminal activity is crossed.
Prevention programming – programmes that seek to reduce the appeal of violent extremism and build resilience to its influence and spread.
The types of programmes that may fall under this category are: awareness raising on the threat of violent extremism in schools, public information campaigns and community debates, inter-faith and intra-faith dialogues, capacity building for teachers and community leaders in identifying and supporting those vulnerable to radicalization, media messaging and counter-/alternative narrative campaigns, and community trust building with law enforcement, etc.
Protective factors – positive characteristics or conditions that can moderate the negative effects of risk factors and foster healthier individuals, families, and communities, thereby increasing personal and/or community safety and wellbeing.
These factors can include expectation management, positive family or social networks, religious knowledge, education that teaches tolerance and respect for others, and a fairer job market.
Radicalization that leads to terrorism – the dynamic process whereby an individual comes to accept terrorist violence as a possible, perhaps even legitimate, course of action.
This may eventually, but not necessarily, lead this person to advocate, act in support of, or to engage in, terrorism.
Rehabilitation programming – programmes that target individuals radicalized to violence and possibly their families at different stages of radicalization.
The types of programmes include both prison-based de-radicalization/disengagement and post-criminal aftercare programmes focusing on the rehabilitation and reintegration of terrorist offenders and returning foreign fighters, and their reentry into society.
Some programmes offer educational and vocational training, counselling, employment opportunities and ideological re-education, etc.
Referrals – include individuals who are referred to multiagency or other multistakeholder programmes and who display observable behaviours indicating they might be at risk of or vulnerable to engagement in VERLT or already on the path to VERLT.
Referrals also include individuals whom a program refers to an agency, institution, organization, or professionals for an intervention or other support following a professional assessment of the individual’s risks, vulnerabilities, and protective factors.
Referral mechanism – a formal or informal mechanism involving practitioners and professionals from different disciplines and/or agencies and organizations that aims to identify, assess, assist, and treat those individuals showing signs of being at risk of or vulnerable to engagement in VERLT or already on the path to VERLT.
Resilience – the ability to withstand, respond to and recover from a wide range of harmful and adverse events.
Risk assessment – the process involving the systematic gathering and interpretation of information pertaining to an individual to provide data for properly trained professionals to make decisions relevant to the likelihood that a specific individual will engage in harmful action and to assess the nature and severity of the harm.
Risk assessment tool – a framework for collecting data to assist with decisionmaking that provides a non-discriminatory method for examining in a structured way an individual’s propensity to cause harm and the nature and severity of that risk, based on available information from multiple sources.
Risk factor – any attribute such as belief, appearance, experience, or environment that increases the likelihood of the outcome being measured (e.g., that an individual will engage in VERLT) occurring.
Whole-of-society approach – an approach to preventing and countering violent extremism advocated by policymakers and practitioners that envisions a role for multiple sectors and civil society actors in prevention, intervention, and deradicalization/disengagement rehabilitation programmes.
1. INTRODUCTION
The spread of violent extremism continues to pose a serious global challenge that the OSCE is committed to preventing and countering through its comprehensive approach to security while ensuring that human rights and the rule of law are respected.
The rapid rise of Daesh/ISIS in Iraq and Syria resulted in hundreds of foreign terrorist fighters leaving the Western Balkans to support their cause, including an estimated 110 citizens from the Republic of North Macedonia that may be higher given that no recent official data exist.
The dismantling of many Daesh safe havens since 2017 has also created a new set of challenges due to the flow of returning foreign terrorist fighters to the region.
At the same time, the threat of violent extremism continues to evolve, with new forms emerging – such as far-right movements and extreme nationalism – which further polarize societies and may also lead to community-based violence.
The OSCE Ministerial Council Declaration 4/15 affirms that terrorism and violent extremism cannot be linked to any race, ethnicity, nationality or religion.
It is widely acknowledged that violent extremism and radicalization that leads to terrorism (VERLT) is a complex problem with transnational dimensions, yet its drivers and solutions are closely tied to the context in which it exists.
In addition to national governments playing a vital role in coordinating and supporting early prevention activities, the OSCE also recognizes the need to place local stakeholders at the forefront of prevention efforts.
The importance of a multi-stakeholder approach to preventing and countering VERLT
In line with established best practice in the OSCE, P/CVERLT requires a holistic approach with the engagement of diverse institutions and civil society together with local communities.
In particular, a public health approach to prevention programming offers opportunities for practitioners to use lessons learned from the field of disease prevention through multi-stakeholder initiatives to identify risk and protective factors, build community resilience and promote healthy behaviours through community engagement.
These multi-stakeholder practices, when combined with community-led efforts to prevent violent extremism, have the advantage of broadly including social workers, mental health workers, psychologists and other health workers who are increasingly becoming involved in efforts to reduce violence in communities.
Using a whole-of-society approach recognizes the social roots of the phenomenon of violent extremism and allows for early interventions and non-coercive solutions when individuals or communities are at risk by addressing the factors conducive to VERLT.
The identification of sustainable solutions for building resilience to VERLT also necessitates a shift from past security-led approaches towards a greater emphasis on community-based prevention.
P/CVERLT efforts therefore seek to mobilize and empower stakeholders not traditionally associated with national security.
In contrast to countering terrorism, which uses a repressive approach in dealing with the criminal space, P/CVERLT is non-coercive in nature and focuses on preventing and countering processes of radicalization that may lead to terrorism.
As P/CVERLT efforts are undertaken in the pre-criminal space, they do not involve prosecutions, arrests, or other repressive measures.
The aim of P/CVERLT is accordingly not to reach individuals who have already crossed into the criminal realm, i.e. planning or undertaking terrorist activity, but rather to build resilience among communities seen as potentially vulnerable to the appeal of violent extremism and to assist individuals willing to disengage from violent extremism and reintegrate into their communities.
P/CVERLT focuses on addressing and reducing grievances and structural social, economic, and political conditions that may be conducive to violent extremism.
Violent extremists often work towards inciting individual and collective hatred, promoting intolerance towards diversity, and creating societal divisions.
Therefore, supporting the development of resilient and socially cohesive communities can be the best defense against violent extremism from taking root.
In working together, communities can counter the corrosive appeal of violent extremism by promoting tolerance, mutual respect, pluralism, inclusion, and cohesion.
Ultimately, P/CVERLT efforts should center on the wellbeing and safety of communities and individuals.
P/CVERLT efforts entail a broad range of programming that can include, for example, awareness raising, capacity building, counter and alternative narrative messaging, targeted programs for schools, extracurricular activities (e.g., youth and sports clubs), mentoring by religious and community leaders, and individually tailored interventions organized by local public institutions and psycho-social service providers.
These activities can be categorized according to whether they pertain to prevention, intervention, or rehabilitation and reintegration.
Rationale behind local-level roundtables
In February 2018, the OSCE Mission to Skopje, in partnership with the British Embassy, facilitated two public consultation roundtables with local stakeholders to inform the drafting of the Government’s revised Strategies and Action Plans for Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) and Counterterrorism (CT), under the National Committee for Countering Violent Extremism and Counter-terrorism (NCCVECT).
This effort for a consultative drafting process was the first in the region of the Western Balkans and one of few such examples globally.
Following the adoption of the National Strategy, the Mission organized a series of roundtables with key local stakeholders in fall 2018 as part of a strategic communications campaign in support of the NCCVECT to disseminate the Strategy. With the participation of the National Coordinator’s Office, the roundtables served to enhance transparency and ensure consistency in strategy messaging at the local level.
The roundtables were organized in ten geographically dispersed municipalities: Chair (Skopje), Gostivar, Kichevo, Kumanovo, Prilep, Shtip, Struga, Strumica, Tetovo, and Veles.
In order to promote a multi-stakeholder, community-based approach to the implementation of the National Strategy and Action Plan, the roundtables sought to include the participation of representatives from the municipal administration, civil society, local institutions, educators, psycho-social care providers, youth, religious leaders and other influential members of the local community.
Objectives of the roundtables
In addition to raising awareness of local stakeholders of the risks of VERLT, the primary aim of the roundtables was to foster ownership and buy-in from local institutions, civil society and communities for implementing the National Strategy and Action Plan for CVE.
The roundtables also provided a crucial opportunity to assess the needs and priorities in each Municipality for adopting a multi-stakeholder approach to implementing the National Strategy and Action Plan in the local context.
With consideration given to the sensitivities surrounding P/CVERLT, the Mission’s whole-of-society approach aimed to achieve a number of outcomes from the roundtables, including
Promoting a holistic understanding of violent extremism that addresses the phenomenon in all forms (e.g., right wing, exclusivist nationalist, political), thus reducing the stigma of ethnic and religious communities and allowing for broadened discussions on what forms of violent extremism exist in the country and in the local context.
Supporting a shift from the traditional security-led approaches towards emphasizing a whole-of-society approach that serves to empower community stakeholders by treating them as key parts of the solution.
Providing a safe space and platform for dialogue for participants to voice their concerns openly and initiate confidence-building both between local communities and with government structures.
Empowering stakeholders to establish channels for enhanced communication and co-operation.
Identifying potential challenges and opportunities for a multi-stakeholder approach to the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan.
Clarifying roles and responsibilities between the central and local government, and between government and civil society.
Collaboratively identifying findings and recommendations to serve as a preliminary basis for the future development of local action plans.
This report provides a summary overview of the local stakeholder-led discussions in the ten municipal roundtables.
The next section provides a description of the methodology of the roundtables, followed by the key findings and conclusions.
The final section elaborates recommended best practices drawn from the findings for implementing P/CVERLT programming.
An annex provides a detailed overview into the proceedings of the roundtables in Chair, Gostivar, Kumanovo, Struga, and Tetovo in the form of reports developed by the OSCE Mission to Skopje’s implementing partner, the Center for Research and Policy Making (CRPM).
As one of its main objectives, the report seeks to highlight the importance of promoting a multi-stakeholder approach to implementing the National Strategy for CVE with an understanding of a shared responsibility for security.
The roundtable findings also serve to demonstrate the benefit of ensuring an inclusive process in the conceptualization and design of policies and strategies on P/CVERLT, both at the national and local level.
The report is written for a broad audience, including policymakers and practitioners who are working to develop and implement P/CVERLT policies, strategies, action plans, and programmes.
It is also specifically written for local stakeholders – including municipal authorities and other local institutions, and local practitioners and professionals, as well as members of civil society — who might be involved in the design and implementation of P/CVERLT programmes.
Finally, the report is also intended to raise awareness of the importance of trustbased collaboration between policymakers and practitioners when developing and realizing these programmes.
2. METHODOLOGY OF THE ROUNDTABLES WITH LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS
The Mission based the methodology of the roundtables on the same whole-ofsociety approach it applied in designing and carrying out the public consultations for the drafting of the National Strategy for CVE in early 2018.
In pioneering an ambitious and inclusive approach to promoting multi-stakeholder engagement in P/CVERLT, the roundtable methodology provides a valuable example of best practices for policymakers and practitioners involved in designing similar public outreach processes for other national strategies.
The following section provides an overview of the methodological approach used in selecting the municipalities and participants for the roundtables, as well as designing the structure of the guided discussions.
This section also discusses the harm reduction strategies and confidence-building measures used by the Mission when conducting outreach to local stakeholders.
Selection of municipalities and participants for the roundtables
The Mission, in coordination with the NCCVECT, selected the ten municipalities based on a list of criteria that ensured geographical diversity and avoided stigmatizing certain minority ethnic communities that could create the public perception that only these communities struggle with the challenge of VERLT.
Furthermore, allowing for broad coverage of the country in organizing the roundtables also shifted focus away from areas where ongoing and planned P/ CVERLT activities were already highly concentrated and reinforced the message that all forms of VERLT would be addressed.
In identifying participants for the roundtables, the Mission relied on its field presence to conduct outreach to an extensive network of stakeholders among local self-government institutions, civil society, educators, youth, religious and local community leaders, all of which play an important role in the community based-approach that is the basis of P/CVERLT.
In many cases, the roundtables represented the first time when all the relevant local stakeholders were brought together in the same room as part of a dialogue.
Intensive groundwork was carried out through numerous preparatory meetings with stakeholders to identify appropriate participants and to address any concerns, including risks of stigmatization.
In acknowledging the general lack of public awareness and sensitivity around P/CVERLT, the Mission focused on identifying individuals who had prior experience with the subject matter or whose work was in a closely related field.
In identifying participants, the Mission took great care to ensure diverse representation of all ethnic and religious communities present in each municipal context.
Particular emphasis was placed on ensuring that the needs and perspectives of the smaller minority communities were reflected in the roundtable discussions.
Participants were also invited from local women’s and youth groups to further enrich the discussion and empower these groups in building coalitions within civil society and to increase co-operation with local institutions.
The design of the roundtables had to contend with P/CVERLT’s legacy of predominantly focusing on religiously-inspired forms of VERLT, which has resulted in the stigmatization of certain religious communities and strained relations between these communities on the one hand and institutions and law enforcement on the other.
Another result of this legacy is that religious leaders often perceive that they are expected to have all the solutions to preventing and countering VERLT, even when they lack the appropriate capacities, resources, and necessary support from other stakeholders.
A whole-of-society approach to P/CVERLT avoids defining VERLT as a theological issue and thus placing the burden of responsibility solely on religious leaders, and instead recognizes VERLT as a social phenomenon that situates religious leaders among a collective of stakeholders committed to building community resilience.
In preparation for the roundtables, religious leaders were encouraged to use the open forum to express both their ideas and concerns while engaging in dialogue with the other stakeholders present. Additionally, in order to support trust-building, the Mission conducted on-the-ground outreach to local representatives of religious communities to clearly explain the purpose of the roundtables and address their grievances, particularly regarding stigmatization.
The preparatory meetings provided the opportunity to emphasize a holistic understanding of P/CVERLT, which encompasses all forms of violent extremism and refrains from targeting any particular ethnic or religious group, in addition to promoting a whole-ofsociety approach.
The Mission also sought to include teachers and other educational support staff (e.g., school psychologists, pedagogues) in the roundtables, given their important role in directly influencing the worldviews and values of youth during a critical period in their lives for their cognitive development and identity formation.
Teachers are also well placed to intervene and support a young person who may be struggling with or vulnerable to negative social phenomena.
At the same time, P/CVERLT efforts in the region tend to focus on building the capacities of educators to recognize signs of radicalization, with the risk of doing harm in the absence of proper training, instead of empowering them with the right tools to build the resilience of youth to VERLT (e.g., by reforming teaching methodologies and placing greater emphasis in the curriculum on fostering critical thinking, respect for diversity, and the promotion of non-violent behaviors).
With this in mind, the Mission also invited representatives of the regional units of the Bureau for Development of Education that work on developing school curricula, in addition to local education officers from the religious institutions who also play an important role in youth development.
Drawing from best practice in the domain of public health prevention efforts, the Mission also invited psycho-social care providers to participate in the roundtables.
Professionals in the fields of social welfare and mental health have extensive experience from initiatives supporting vulnerable individuals at risk of engaging in other types of negative social behaviors, such as youth delinquency.
Additionally, psycho-social care providers are bound by a professional code of ethics that governs the client-provider relationship through principles such as trust and emphasis on supporting the individual’s wellbeing.
Whereas an oversecuritized approach toward P/CVERLT with significant involvement of law enforcement can result in displacing and alienating psycho-social care providers, a public health approach creates the space for their engagement.
The purpose of including psycho-social care providers was thus to raise their awareness of VERLT and the important contribution they can make in bolstering protective factors.
Central to a do-no-harm approach in relation to VERLT is a nuanced understanding of community dynamics and sensitivities.
Given the sensitive nature of P/CVERLT, the Mission took into consideration the existing mistrust expressed by communities – especially minority ethnic communities -- towards institutions and law enforcement. Often in engagement efforts between police and the public, there is a perception that the security-driven agendas of law enforcement tend to displace other important local community concerns and grievances, especially when the interaction is one-way in nature.
Given the existing taboos around VERLT and the associated fears of negative repercussions from discussing the issue in the presence of law enforcement, the Mission prioritized the roundtables as a safe space for all participants to share their views on local problems and grievances.
Consequently, representatives of the police were not invited to the roundtables in order to ensure an open forum for discussion and to strengthen an understanding of P/CVERLT as a communitybased, multi-stakeholder effort carried out in a pre-criminal space.
This approach aimed to allow the community to feel engaged for their own benefit and that they too have an important stake in contributing to the security and wellbeing of their community.
Structure of the roundtables
Recognizing the taboos around VERLT and the general lack of public awareness in this area as of fall 2018, the Mission opted to structure the roundtables as fullday events to allow enough time for discussion to develop in sufficient depth.
Each roundtable accordingly began with an overview of key concepts and terminology to ensure that participants had a common understanding for the subsequent discussion sessions.
This conceptual session was then followed by a presentation of the National Strategy for CVE, led by the National Coordinator or his Deputy for CVE.
The active participation of the NCCVECT throughout the roundtables resulted in dynamic interaction between the central and local level by directly answering the queries of participants, as well as hearing first-hand their perspectives, grievances, and ideas for solutions.
The discussion sessions were organized around key intersectional areas and facilitated by an experienced moderator with the support of guiding questions prepared in advance of the roundtables.
Each of the thematic sessions allowed participants from all backgrounds to contribute to identifying local challenges and opportunities related to the implementation of the Strategy and Action Plan in the local context.
Participants were informed that the “Chatham House Rule” would be applied in order to protect their identity and allow for an open discussion.
The roundtable sessions were organized around the following themes
Violent extremism in the local context.
Empowering civil society and sharing best practices.
Engagement between the municipality and community.
Building trust between communities and law enforcement.
The role of communities in the prevention of violent extremism.
Education and supporting at-risk youth.
The importance of social welfare and mental health.
Taking into account the sensitivity of discussing violent extremism with local communities, the Mission placed considerable emphasis on selecting moderators and rapporteurs with appropriate skills and abilities.
An additional consideration in identifying moderators and rapporteurs was building civil society capacity in the field of P/CVERLT to continue working on long-term policy change.
Consequently, the Mission identified CRPM, a leading policy think tank that was carrying out research, together with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in municipalities overlapping with those selected for the roundtables to assess local institutional capacities to implement the National Strategy.
By promoting synergies among initiatives, the Mission aimed to ensure that the research and roundtable discussions built upon each other for assisting the government, the local institutions and the civil society to create the best possible multi-stakeholder approach to P/CVERLT.
3. FINDINGS
This section provides an overview of the findings of the roundtables. Organized according to the structure of the sessions in most of the roundtables, the findings in each thematic area are complemented with attention to local specifics of particular interest.
3.1. Violent extremism in the local context
Taken together, the roundtables suggested that awareness of VERLT is generally low, and most roundtable participants took the position that violent extremism is not widespread in their municipality, though the issue of local citizens going to fight in Syria was raised in several roundtables.
Additionally, there was generally a high level of awareness that while violent extremism may start small, it can also grow quickly in the presence of visible examples/ role models.
It was also noted that discussion of VERLT is treated as a taboo, with the stifling effect on such discussion counterproductive from the standpoint of preventing violent extremism.
Participants also noted that violent extremism is most often associated with religious manifestations, resulting in the stigmatization of some communities, and identified right wing and nationalist extremism as also being prevalent in the country.
Notwithstanding the position of most roundtable participants that violent extremism is not widespread, the roundtables yielded evidence of the recognition of a fairly wide range of manifestations of the phenomenon.
On one end of the spectrum, roundtable participants mentioned graffiti expressing insults and violent intentions and/or ideas as a low-intensity form of violent extremism, with participants at the roundtable in Prilep noting also that the failure to remove such graffiti contributes to the normalization of such messages.
The roots of intolerance and hate first also manifest as verbal confrontations before escalating to physical violence, including most notably fights on inter-ethnic basis among secondary school students at schools and on public transportation.
Where hate speech and physical violence by sports (usually football) fan groups are concerned, the roundtables revealed widespread recognition of such activity as a form of violent extremism with participants in Chair noting alleged influence from political parties.
In Prilep, participants identified the burning of the Charshi Mosque and the effective expulsion of ethnic Albanian families in 2001 as an extreme manifestation of VERLT.
Discussion of the factors potentially conducive of VERLT pointed to the prominence of family-related concerns.
Common among roundtable participants was the view that the internal cohesion of families is not as strong as it once was, leading youth to seek identity and belonging in other kinds of groups, such as ethnic communities, political parties, religious communities, and sports fan groups.
In some roundtables, participants referred also to the absence of parents, often as a result of labor migration stemming from high unemployment.
At the roundtable in Chair, participants related the absence of a parent to increased vulnerability to extremist preachers.
Various issues of gender also received mention, including domestic violence, lack of respect for women in general, and, in Veles, conservative values preventing mothers from attending meetings in school.
In addition to family dynamics, roundtable participants identified a range of other causes of VERLT.
As mentioned above in relation to labor migration, economic conditions were frequently cited as a condition conducive to violent extremism.
As one participant in the roundtable in Veles put it, „We wouldn‘t be discussing these problems if [the living standard] were higher.“
Sometimes mentioned by roundtable participants in combination with poverty and unemployment was marginalization on ethnic and/or religious grounds.
Ethnic and religious marginalization was explained as a factor potentially influencing an individual’s search for identity and belonging in such a way as to make violent extremist groups more attractive.
Additionally, it was noted that some marginalized segments of society may seeks support from alternative religious groups outside of official religious institutions out of a perception that these groups are closer to the people and their needs.
Another type of cause identified in the roundtables relates to access to information.
As noted by roundtable participants, media often play a destructive role by spreading hate speech and playing up interethnic tensions in the way they cover incidents where the perpetrator is a member of a minority group.
Youth’s often unregulated access to mobile phones received frequent mention, and the hate speech common in media and social media was identified as a push factor toward violent extremism.
Also receiving frequent mention in the roundtables was the politicization of life and institutions in North Macedonia, sometimes in the form of incitement to extremism by political parties in power and by parties’ youth wings.
The storming of parliament on 27 April 2017 was mentioned in several roundtables as an example of political party involvement in violent extremism.
In Gostivar, participants pointed out that one extreme leads to another, especially where a culture of violence is normalized and politics is focused on hatred and/or revenge.
High levels of political polarization impede the functioning of institutions, leading in turn to a lack of public trust in those same institutions.
3.2. Empowering civil society and sharing best practices
Discussion of civil society in the roundtables pointed both to widespread recognition of civil society’s potential role in identifying and taking preventive action against various forms of violent extremism.
A wide range of variation across localities in civil society’s strength and relations with local communities and institutions was also noted.
While more capacity building on P/CVERLT is needed, participants also assessed that CSOs already have extensive experience in areas related to violence prevention and building social cohesion that could be better supported.
At the same time, participants urged caution towards involving CSOs that lack the appropriate expertise on P/CVERLT and suggested that more effort should be made to facilitate the sharing of best practices.
Participants also identified several areas in which CSOs can increase the focus of their activities in P/CVERLT, such as engaging parents in violence prevention, promoting human rights through nonformal education, and providing training to media organizations on conflict sensitivity in their reporting.
During the roundtable discussions, participants provided numerous examples of positive contributions by local CSOs to the prevention of violent extremism.
In Gostivar CSOs have been implementing various projects to build resilience within the local community, with relevant projects including digital skills training for marginalized youth and the opening of a youth center, as well as other initiatives focused on bringing together youth from diverse backgrounds.
As explained by roundtable participants, good relations between civil society and local government also led to the establishment in Gostivar of the country’s first municipal youth council however it was noted that the youth council faces challenges with insufficient funding for activities.
Some CSOs in Kumanovo have not only taken a public stand against violent extremism, but also undertaken preventive work with youth susceptible to joining violent extremist groups abroad.
Additionally, the roundtables in Prilep and Tetovo revealed civil society capacity built in providing assistance to vulnerable individuals that could potentially be applied in relation to preventing violent extremism.
At the same time, participants at the roundtables in Kumanovo and Prilep noted that CSOs struggle to sustain long-term programming due to a lack of funds, with the discussion in Kumanovo identifying the need for donors to take local priorities and existing programming into account in allocating their funding.
Participants at the roundtable in Kumanovo also noted that while local civil society is relatively strong in its own right, co-operation between CSOs, schools, and municipal authorities needs strengthening.
Moreover, even in Gostivar, where roundtable participants assessed the position and role of civil society positively, it was noted that civil society had suffered in the past from pressure exerted by the state through politically targeted audits and inspections.
While the roundtable discussions in several municipalities yielded insight into the strengths of local civil society to prevent violent extremism, the roundtables in Chair and Struga showed a less positive situation.
In these municipalities, co-operation between civil society and local institutions is characterized as weak, with low levels of trust and awareness about local CSO programming on the part of local authorities.
Participants in the roundtables in Chair and Struga also made note of negative public perceptions of CSOs in these municipalities as being influenced by personal, political, and/or criminal agendas that effectively undermine the idea of volunteerism and civic activism.
Additional findings from the roundtable in Chair include low levels of awareness on the part of CSOs about the availability of municipal premises for their activities, as well as difficulties experienced by CSOs in obtaining funding from the municipality.
Finally, participants at the roundtable in Chair pointed out that most locally active CSOs are humanitarian, with few organizations implementing cultural activities or activities designed to raise civic awareness and engagement.
Concern was also raised by religious communities that some foreign funded humanitarian organizations were allegedly carrying out activities with political or religious undertones and non-transparent motivations.
3.3. Engagement between the municipality and community
The findings of the roundtables suggest that levels of engagement between municipality and community vary widely in much the same way as the strength and role of civil society at the local level, as discussed above.
The provisions for coordination between municipality and community receiving most frequent mention at the roundtables were neighbourhood-level administrative units (mesni zaednici) and Local Prevention Councils (LPCs).
With regard to the former, participants in the roundtables in Kumanovo and Tetovo lamented the loss of neighbourhood-level administrative units’ status in 2002, as a result these units no longer have access to a bank account, official stamp or seal.
They described the units as an important and often effective mechanism for engagement between local authorities and local communities due to their overview of grassroots-level developments, but said the units encounter difficulties in resolving community issues because they function since 2002 on a voluntary basis.
Participants therefore urged that a new law be passed to reinstate the status of the local neighborhood units.
Where LPCs are concerned, the roundtables made clear that these mechanisms have the potential to serve as a municipality-led tool for ensuring that all stakeholders are included in discussing issues of public safety.
However, the absence of a legal requirement for all municipalities to establish LPCs, in addition to other challenges for multi-agency cooperation, has prevented the establishment and continued function of such a body in all of the municipalities in which the roundtables were held.
In Kumanovo, an LPC exists, but was characterized by roundtable participants as hardly functional as a result of appointments made on the basis of political affiliation rather than expertise.
Participants in other roundtables referred to the LPCs in their respective municipalities as inactive or never established, while participants in Prilep stated that were an LPC to be established in the future, it would be important to ensure broader focus than only VERLT.
Furthermore, participants suggested that LPCs should ensure that individuals with the appropriate competencies and commitment be included as permanent members to ensure consistency and sustainability.
In addition to different institutions, participants also proposed that representatives of CSOs and communities be included in the LPC configuration.
In the absence of a functioning LPC or other mechanisms that can be used for preventing violent extremism, the roundtables held in Gostivar and Kumanovo provided insight into existing and planned coordination bodies for addressing other types anti-social and violent phenomena.
In Gostivar, where participants made note of relevant, but unfunded, mechanisms for coordination (e.g., a coordination body for the prevention of gender-based violence) and also called on the municipality to take violent extremism more seriously, they also welcomed the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the CSO Search for Common Ground to establish a Community Action Team that will work on a local action plan for CVE and will advise the Municipal Council on related matters.
Community Action Teams have also been established in the municipalities of Chair and Kichevo.
At the same time, participants in this roundtable noted that many of the problems faced by the municipality need to be addressed at the central level.
In Kichevo, participants requested that representatives of smaller minority communities and from rural settlements be included in any coordinative body working on P/CVERLT to contribute towards identifying issues and solutions.
In Kumanovo, information on issues of public concern is shared among neighbourhood units, the Committee for Inter-Community Relations (CICR), and the security committee of the municipal council, with the sources protected.
In both Kumanovo and Kichevo, participants noted that although a Committee for Inter-Community Relations has been established, its voluntary character has made it difficult to address issues in a preventive manner, in addition to organize the annual meeting for drafting a program to be implemented by the Municipality’s cultural section.
Additionally, while the Municipality in Kumanovo maintains good relations with local religious organizations, there is no inter-religious body and generally little co-operation between religious communities.
More worrying, according to roundtable participants, is the lack of trust in institutions on the part of citizens, particularly among the more vulnerable segments of society, which often prevents them from receiving needed assistance.
Whereas the roundtables in Gostivar and Kumanovo yielded evidence of functional provisions for coordination between municipality and community in the prevention of violent extremism, discussion at the roundtables in Chair, Prilep, Tetovo, and Struga focused on the absence of such provisions.
At the roundtable in Chair, participants noted a lack of dialogue and co-operation between local communities and the municipality while pointing to the potential for the municipality to initiate community engagement through joint activities in the sphere of culture.
In Prilep, roundtable participants presented the now-defunct youth council for juvenile delinquency as an example of good practice for bringing together parents’ councils, education representatives, and providers of psycho-social services.
However, they also conveyed the perception that local authorities have avoided contact with the Islamic Religious Community (IRC) since the IRC requested the restoration of the Charshi Mosque.
Participants at the roundtable in Struga characterized the non-functioning of the LPC as symptomatic of a broader lack of inter-sectoral co-operation in the Municipality, also pointing to challenges in accessing and addressing the needs of the rural communities surrounding the town of Struga.
Finally, a barrier to engagement between municipality and community identified by participants of the roundtable in Tetovo was the municipality’s financial difficulties, including most notably the blocking of its bank account for several years.
3.4. Building trust between communities and law enforcement
Overall, the roundtables made clear that trust between communities and law enforcement is lacking for a number of different reasons.
In Struga and Tetovo, for example, participants attributed low levels of trust in law enforcement to the ineffectiveness of police in enforcing the law when the perpetrators of crimes are believed to be politically connected.
As explained by participants at the roundtable in Struga, the perceived inconsistent application of the law by police provides impunity for well-known local criminals, effectively promoting a life of crime as a viable option for youth.
In Tetovo and Chair, citizens are also afraid to report their concerns directly to the police for fear of retaliation from the perpetrators, and would prefer anonymous reporting.
The low representation of ethnic Albanians in various organs of the Ministry of Interior was also mentioned as a factor in the trust deficit, despite the existence of affirmative action for the equitable representation of ethnic communities in the police.
The recruitment of law enforcement officials on the basis of political party affiliation was mentioned in Chair and Kumanovo as a cause of low levels of citizen trust in law enforcement.
Widespread lack of trust in police was evident also in roundtable participants’ views expressed on the appropriate role of law enforcement in the prevention of violent extremism.
Participants in Chair, Kumanovo, and Tetovo conveyed fears of stigmatization and of being implicated by police in unnecessary investigations, with participants in Chair warning that disproportionate repressive measures targeting the local community risk creating fertile ground for the spread of VERLT.
Roundtable participants in Struga, on the other hand, expressed concerns about the capacity of police to deal with issues of prevention in addition to their existing caseload.
Reflecting these concerns, roundtable participants explained that police should be engaged only as a last resort or if there is an imminent threat to public safety.
Participants in Chair explained that community-based initiatives for preventing violent extremism in their municipality have made a point of not involving law enforcement officials for fear of doing harm, while participants in Gostivar emphasized that the strategic plan to be developed by the Community Action Team for prevention of violent extremism should avoid reliance on the police.
At the same time, participants called for more trust-building between communities and the police through an open forum as a mechanism to share their community safety concerns however, they noted that the police work from a highly centralized level which poses challenges to being able to address concerns raised in a timely manner.
Taking into account low levels of community trust in law enforcement, the roundtables also probed co-operation between law enforcement on the one hand and schools and centers for social work on the other.
While such cooperation generally received low marks from roundtable participants and most took the view that cases of youth delinquency should first be handled internally by school-based psycho-social support staff rather than involving police, roundtable participants in Strumica and Veles made note of good cooperation between police and schools.
Finally, notwithstanding roundtable participants’ predominantly negative views of the role of police in relation to preventing violent extremism, participants in some roundtables recalled previous community policing practices, such as patrolman (pozornikar9), in positive terms and pointed to their potential role in preventing violent extremism by maintaining contacts at grassroots level.
3.5. The role of communities in the prevention of violent extremism
Discussion of the role of communities in preventing violent extremism focused in large part on families and religious communities, with many roundtable participants voicing that the prevention of violent extremism begins at home and in early childhood development.
In several roundtables, participants emphasized that the focus should be on strengthening the family unit given it is the source for developing values of inter-religious and inter-ethnic tolerance.
Violence in the family should also be addressed to counter the normalization of violence in society more broadly.
Statements like these were often followed by observations about the potential for school-based parent councils to take an active role in raising awareness of the risks associated with violent extremism.
Moreover, parents should become more informed about their role in monitoring their child’s activity on the internet and ensuring their protection from online risks, including from content related to VERLT.
At the roundtable in Chair, participants spoke about the important role of women in preventing VERLT, noting that they can take the lead in their families to foster positive inter-religious and inter-ethnic relations, both proactively and in response to fights among youth at school and on public transport.
In this regard, the project “Mothers Schools” of the CSO Women without Borders received recognition from roundtable participants in Chair for empowering women to lead their families and communities in building resilience against VERLT.
In terms of dialogue and co-operation between religious communities, participants highlighted that on a higher level, the heads of religious communities meet twice a year to discuss activities, but at the local level there is insufficient communication between the Islamic Religious Community (IRC) and the Macedonian Orthodox Church (MOC).
Intensified co-operation is needed to foster tolerance, for example by engaging in joint activities of mutual interest (e.g. cleaning the litter in a park) at the local level.
Participants at the roundtable in Kumanovo singled out as an example of good practice the forum for religious leaders organized after the violent incidents in May 2015 to discuss how best to prevent further escalation of the situation.
Also common were calls from representatives of both the IRC and the MOC for the incorporation of ethics and religion classes in school curricula, taught by appropriately qualified teachers, to promote ethics and religious tolerance.
The roundtable discussions also examined the relationship between the construction of religious spaces of worship and symbolic objects on the one hand and interethnic and inter-religious relations on the other.
Whereas in most cases this relationship was described in terms of how the construction of religious buildings can provoke inter-communal tensions, the discussion in Struga also highlighted how religious leaders played a constructive role in preventing an escalation to violence in the village of Oktisi over the construction of a church without a permit.
From a different perspective, participants explained that some religious communities have longstanding grievances that should be addressed.
Mentioned in the roundtables in both Prilep and Gostivar, the failure of local authorities to restore the burned down Charshi Mosque in Prilep from the 2001 conflict has prevented true reconciliation between ethnic and religious communities.
As a result, there remains considerable need for work on inter-religious dialogue in that municipality.
At the roundtable in Gostivar, the low level of communication between religious communities and local institutions was explained in terms of the legacy of communism and its propagation of anti-religious views.
Beyond references to specific religious communities, participants in some roundtables called for greater transparency and regulation within religious institutions in general as one participant in the roundtable in Veles put it, “We can’t know what the priest and the imam say.
We need to see what they’re preaching.”
In addition, MOC representatives participating in one of the roundtables pointed to cases in which individuals espousing extreme beliefs seek to manipulate national and religious identities, noting that some priests and members of the Church have an ideological approach and are difficult to keep under control.
Among the concerns raised at the roundtables in relation to Muslim communities in North Macedonia, the most common related to the challenges for IRC of addressing the misuse of religion in such a way as to prevent VERLT.
At several roundtables, representatives of IRC spoke of foreign and/ or “extremist” organizations that carry out religious activities outside the control of official religious bodies, sometimes under the guise of cultural and humanitarian activities.
Participants at the roundtables in Gostivar and Struga also noted that their reports to police about such practices have not led to action.
In Gostivar, roundtable participants further made note of the circulation of large quantities of religious literature without IRC oversight, arguing that VERLT can be prevented by increasing religious literacy and promoting a strong grounding in the Hanafi tradition officially followed in the country.
Similarly, participants at the roundtable in Gostivar suggested that religious leaders should raise their profile on online social media to reduce the influence of extremist preachers among youth and offer alternative narratives.
