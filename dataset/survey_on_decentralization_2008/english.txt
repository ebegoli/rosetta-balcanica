Introduction
The 2008 survey on decentralization builds on the findings outlined in the 2006 and 2007 editions.
The Public Administration Reform Department (PARD) of the OSCE Spill-over Monitor Mission to Skopje acquired significant experience in analyzing develop-ments related to decentralization, and this survey represents a valid contribution for stakeholders interested in particular aspects of the process.
The survey was conducted between July and November 2008, and it grounds its find-ings on field research conducted by the OSCE SMMS PARD officers in all units of local self-government across the country.
A set of 99 questions drafted by the OSCE was de-livered to relevant municipal departments; answers were collected and processed in a database containing input from over 84 per cent of municipalities.
The data received from the local self-government units are complemented by the outcome of a tele-phone poll commissioned from Brima Gallup – Skopje and implemented with sample of 1,408 persons during October 2008.
The 2008 opinion poll component differs from last year’s research, as the number of questions increased significantly (nearly match-ing the size of the questionnaire posed to municipal administrations).
Moreover, the sample was structured in a stratified way, i.e. selecting targets with a direct interest in the municipal service at stake (e.g. teachers, pupils and their parents for the part on education, local businessmen for the text about local economic development, etc.).
The composition of the sample is outlined in each chapter.
Local governance entails a variety of different issues.
This study focuses on seven areas of interest which the OSCE considers among the most relevant to the ongoing de-centralization process.
Five of them (urban planning, communal services, education, municipal finance and local economic development) have also been a matter of as-sessment in previous editions of the survey, while the chapter on culture is one of the novelties of this year’s survey.
As was the case for the 2006 and 2007 surveys, the methodology employed in this study is designed to provide information on the internal assessment of the situation by the municipal leadership and administration and also to test to what extent they understand the general overview of the facts and features of the current reforms.
Such findings are compared with citizens’ views on municipal performances, in an attempt to test the perception of decentralization - and local governance in general - of the final users of municipal services.
Most of the results in the report are not focused on accurate statistical data of individual cases, but concentrate instead on revealing the general trends in the decentralization process.
The figures presented in this report are not intended for comparison with official statistics from the host country’s govern-ment or other sources.
Culture
1.1 Background and legal framework
Culture is a segment not included in the two previous OSCE SMMS surveys, and there-fore this chapter will focus on a few issues regarding decentralization in the field of culture such as the transfer of assets, personnel, equipment, staff, and funds as well as the relations between municipalities and the Ministry of Culture.
This chapter will also include an overview on culture at the local level, from developments in the legal framework1 to the main achievements at the field level, and the involvement of the members of ethnicities throughout the country in the cultural institutions and activi-ties through the Commissions for Inter-Community Relations (CICR).
Preserving cultural heritage, celebration of different events and remembrance of per-sons of importance for the culture and history of the municipality are aspects that this chapter will explore, as well as equal opportunities for expression, cultivation and af-firmation of cultural identities of the communities.
1.2 Findings on Culture
The results of the findings show that the organization of cultural events is mainly con-ducted in the municipalities already equipped with cultural centres, mainly located in the urban municipalities.
The central government, that is to say the Ministry of Culture, continues to control the cultural assets, cultural centres and the staff in 64.3 per cent of the municipalities.
Only 35.7 per cent of those municipalities that have cultural cen-tres replied that the Ministry had transferred this competency, assets and staff to the municipalities.
When those municipalities were asked why the Ministry of Culture had not given these assets to be managed by them, the majority of them, 66.7 per cent, replied that this was a decision to be taken by the central government without stating the reason why.
Cultural policies at the local level in 2008 were compared with the activities in 2007.
The chart below shows that almost half of the municipal councils in the country did not adopt an annual plan for culture in 2007.
Out of those that adopted an annual plan for culture, each municipality on average implemented only around 15 per cent of the plan.
The chart highlights a slight increase in interest for culture in 2008.
Moreover, 44 per cent of the interviewed municipalities replied that they have allocated funds in their budgets for cultural activities, ranging from folk festivals and art exhibitions to printing promotional materials and marking historical events and personalities.
When asked about the manner in which the funds were disbursed, 18 per cent replied through ten-dering procedures, 29 per cent through direct contract with cultural associations and NGOs, 50 per cent of the municipalities implemented their activities themselves and only 3 per cent entered into Public Private Partnership to implement cultural activities and events.
Local culture provides a sense of identity for rural communities and residents.
This identity facilitates common understandings, traditions and values, all central to the identification of plans of action to improve well-being.
Despite the fact that 62 per cent of the municipalities replied that they had appointed a person in charge of culture, local culture is rarely seen as playing a significant role in the development outcomes.
Instead, culture is often viewed as an outgrowth of a par-ticular region and dependent upon financial assistance by the central government.
This chapter also aims to give an insight into the ethnic diversity in the country in ref-erence to the cultural activities and to see to what extent this competency has been implemented by the local authorities.
The municipalities with at least 20 per cent of the population not belonging to the main ethnic group present in their territory were assessed on their ability to implement cultural activities reflecting their multi-ethnic background, and to see if cultural initiatives in multi-ethnic municipalities are reviewed by the Commission for Inter-Community Relations to ensure participation of all communities in the cultural life.
In the 22 municipalities, which established these commissions, the cultural initiatives initiated by the respective municipal councils were reviewed by CICR only in 28 per cent of the cases.
1.3 Opinion poll on culture
This survey is supplemented by an opinion poll conducted throughout the country in order to see what the citizens thought about the issue of culture and what they would like their municipalities to do more about the same matter.
It is noteworthy to verify whether the public opinion reckons that decentralization had made a difference in this 
Survey on Decentralization 2008field and, to this respect, 55 per cent of the interviewees expressed satisfaction with the cultural activities in their respective municipalities since the start of the decentral-ization, as opposed to the 45 per cent who had a negative opinion.
The margin was much higher when the citizens were asked if there were more cultural events then than before, 52.8 per cent thought that the decentralization had brought more cultural events than they used to have as opposed to 23.7 per cent who thought that before decentralization culture had been more present in their municipalities.
Answers to the question of what more they would like from their municipalities in terms of culture were heterogeneous.
Engagement of young people in culture and increased number of cultural events prevailed with over 40 per cent each.
This was followed by construction of cultural and sports facilities with 18 per cent of the inter-viewed citizens.
1.4 Conclusions and recommendations
Culture is a competency which is still considered centralized despite the legal provisions deriving from the Law on Culture4 providing grounds for the munici-palities to found cultural institutions and to organize different cultural activities.
Based on the results of the survey, culture is not ranking high in the priorities of the local government units.
There are still cultural assets to be decentralized throughout the country.
Their allocation to municipalities could sensibly foster cultural development.
Culture should be regarded as an integral part of local development.
Just like at the national level, culture is linked to job creation and revenues at the local level too.
Whether in cities or rural areas, culture has become an essential component in the quality of life, and should therefore not be disregarded by stakeholders involved in decentralization.
Local culture presents unique options for locally based economic and other de-velopment.
It is crucial for community development practitioners to consider the importance of culture in the efforts to improve local livelihood.
By paying attention to cultural values, traditions and related factors, more efficient and ef-fective development efforts can be achieved.
Local culture can serve as a basis for development.
Such efforts can serve to promote the local identity, languages and minority cultures.
Efforts can focus on the preservation or promotion of a culture, but can also use culture to mobilize the local population.
Examples of cultural preservation or efforts focusing on culture are often seen in relation to tourism.
These include renovation of villages (architectural rehabilitation, etc.), highlighting the architectural heritage of an area (restoring historic sites to serve as a focal point for tourists), cultural venues (local heritage centres, traditional cultural events), traditional craft and artistic skills (development of industry and employment based on the production of items that are symbolic of the local culture), and culture based entertainment and cultural dissemination (organization of cultural activities, festivals, perma-nent exhibitions).
Providing a local linkage and cultural basis for development is important.
De-velopment efforts that focus on culture provide a mechanism for linking local residents to the development process.
Through such efforts, local residents can encourage development that preserves or promotes their culture.
This is partic-ularly important in the development efforts that seek to elicit local participation, volunteerism, and community action.
These efforts serve as a basis for development, but also serve to maintain cul-tural traditions and ways of life.
Furthermore, such forms of development high-light the importance of rural cultures and identify their role in shaping the wider society.
Finally, through such development, community and cultural identities are reinforced and collective identities are strengthened.
Such interaction can lead to an improved state of community and social well-being.
Education
2.1. Introduction
The process of decentralization in education brought a clearer distinction of roles, rights and responsibilities of the authorities at the central and local level.
It enabled higher participation of local communities in decision-making processes, more active and transparent management of schools through greater involvement of stakehold-ers, and more efficient control over the work and activities in schools and the quality of teaching.
Finally, it enables the municipalities to manage the financial assets allocated for education.
This chapter covers several issues related to local governance and education such as decision-making mechanisms at the school level, the relations and cooperation be-tween schools, municipalities and state bodies, the level of access to information and communication by all stakeholders, the degree of involvement of teachers and parents in school management, the relations between school directors and school boards.
All topics will be tackled from two perspectives as views from municipalities will be com-pared with citizens’ expectations.
2.2. Legal Framework
Article 22 of the Law on Local Self-Government clearly lists municipal competences in the field of education.
Primary and secondary education are also regulated by the Law on Primary Education and its amendments, the Law on Secondary Education and its amendments, the Law on the State Education Inspectorate, and the Law on Financ-ing of the Local Self-Government Units and the Law on the Bureau for Development of Education.
Both primary and secondary education became municipal competences as of 1 July 2005.
The transfer implies municipal ownership of school buildings and other property related to elementary and secondary education, as well as the responsibility for the maintenance of such objects, recruitment of education staff, selection and dismissal of the directors of the schools, the payment of salaries for auxiliary staff together with transport logistics and accommodation for students in dormitories.
Decentralized education entails the participation and the coordination of many stakeholders such as the Local Self-Government Units (LSGU), school directors, parents and students at the local level, and the Ministry of Education (MoE) and its branches at the national level as prescribed by the above mentioned legislation.
Primary and secondary education competences (including its financing) were trans-ferred in July 2007 to the local level in all municipalities that entered the second phase of decentralization, in accordance with the Law on Financing the Local Self-Governments Units.
This means allocation of block grants covering teachers’ salaries and funds for school maintenance.
Block grants cannot be lower than the equivalent funds allocated in the State Budget during the first phase of decentralization.
Munici-palities that have not yet entered the second phase of decentralization continue to use the temporary formula for funding, i.e. teachers’ salaries in primary and secondary education, expenses for the maintenance of school buildings and for the transport of pupils are afforded by central authorities as previously.
2.3. State of Affairs
Education still stands as a crucial matter three years after the beginning of the decen-tralization process.
Municipalities in general pay attention to this competency and try to consolidate it in a way to make it better managed at the local level and to provide better services in the field of education, though results differ significantly among LS-GUs.
Citizens perceive decentralized education as a process able to ensure account-ability, transparency, quality, equity and efficiency.
Many stakeholders (education officials, mayors, school board members, directors, par-ents, teachers, students and others) still show little understanding of their rights, roles and responsibilities in the process.
There is a shared feeling that members of school boards, parents’ councils, parents, teachers and citizens in general have been margin-alized by municipal management, whereas the same applies for what the LSGUs feel about their treatment by the central government (MoE).
Lack of access to informa-tion and communication among stakeholders has also been observed throughout the implementation of the decentralization process (Ananiev, 2008).
Other changes occurred in primary and secondary education15; compulsory atten-dance in primary schools was increased by one year (from eight to nine years) for all students between six and fifteen years of age.
Secondary education is now com-pulsory for all students finishing the nine years of primary education.
These changes represent additional efforts for municipalities to perform and efficiently manage the primary and secondary education.
2.4. Findings from Municipalities Poll
Entering the second phase of decentralization leads municipalities to assume a higher stake in managing education related issues.
Financial obligations deriving from the disbursement of salaries now under the municipal payroll are combined with the management of properties and staff.
To achieve this, municipalities establish an ad-ministrative unit, staffed with qualified people, which deals only with education as a competence.
To the question of the survey ‘Has your municipality already established an administra-tive unit for education’?, 45 per cent of the municipalities answered ‘yes’, while 55 per cent ‘not yet’.
This shows that the process of establishing administrative units has not been completed (see Fig. 1.)
The findings of the Survey also show that of all municipalities that have established administrative units, 70 per cent of them are urban units whereas 30 per cent are rural ones.
It can be understood that even though some rural municipalities have probably entered the second phase of the decentralization process, they are not still in a situa-tion to create such an education unit within their administration (see Fig. 2).
In line with the newly adopted legislation in the field of education school level16, stakeholders (the School Board) now play a more important role than before.
Amend-ments to the laws on primary and secondary education, and deriving from the Law on Local Self-Government (2002), redefined the role of the school board by empowering it with the authority to select and dismiss the school principal17, to set the school budget and to adopt the school statute.
Hence, regular contacts with principals and with the school board members are nec-essary in order to ensure quality management of the education.
To the question ‘How often does your municipality meet the principals and the school board members’?, 8 per cent of the municipalities stated every day, and 42 per cent said once a year, while 25 per cent each answered that they meet every week and once a month respectively (see Fig. 3).
8every day4225every week oncea monthoncea year25(Fig.
3).
How often does your municipality meet the principals and the school board members?
Feedback on the evaluation of school principals and school boards are largely positive.
Seventy one percent of the municipalities with daily contacts with the school stake-holders evaluate their performance as ‘excellent’.
On the other hand, the municipalities with scarce contacts with the school management assessed their work as ‘not good’ in 70 per cent of the cases, whereas only in 10 per cent of the cases they evaluate their work as ‘excellent’, (more details in the Fig. 4).
Regarding the question, ‘Do you think that school level stakeholders (principals, mem-bers of the school boards, teachers and parents) know their rights, roles and respon-sibilities’?, 79 per cent of the municipalities have responded positively while 21 per cent have stated that the school level stakeholders do not know their rights, roles and responsibilities (Fig. 5).
This does not mean that the LSGUs should not continue pro-moting the rights, roles and responsibilities of the school level stakeholders.
Municipalities have also been asked about ‘Which of the stakeholders require train-ing on the issues of education and decentralization’?
Results show that 40 per cent of the municipalities think that School Board members require additional trainings for strengthening their capacities, 25 per cent reckon that teachers require trainings, 20 per cent identify school secretaries, while school principals are considered less in need of trainings (see Fig. 6).
One of the arguments in favor of decentralized education (Levitas, 2002) relates to managerial efficiency and effectiveness and to de-politicization of the education system.
The assumption is that, since the national ministries were farther from schools than the local authorities, many decisions at the local level were done according to political affiliation and its influence.
The decisions brought from a central level con-cerning the education matter at the local level and the experience with other related issues before the decentralization process, also showed that the education system was very centralized and politicized.
Answers to the question ‘Since the decentralization process started, the influence of politics in education has increased, decreased or is it same as before?’ showed that 47 per cent of the municipalities think that the influence of politics in education has ‘de-creased’, since the process of decentralization started, 13 per cent of them think that the influence has ‘increased’ while 40 per cent say that the level of influence ‘remained unvaried’, (see Fig. 7).
Asked about their relations with the Ministry of Education and its branches, 45 per cent of the municipalities answered that they have ‘poor’ relations with the relevant central authorities, 34 per cent reported to have ‘good’ relations with the MoE , whereas 21 per cent have ‘excellent’ relations with the Ministry (see more details at Fig. 8).
Feed-back on relations with the various branches of the MoE18 is generally more positive than the figures relating directly to the MoE.
All these branches are not decentralized, being managed from the central government (Ministry of Education).
Communication with the line Ministry does not appear to be exempted from political influences: the municipalities where mayors share the same political background of the current government seem to have better relations with the Ministry of Education (73 per cent have ‘good relations with the MoE and 27 per cent have ‘excellent’ rela-tions) compared to the overall data (Fig. 9).
The municipalities were finally asked about the desired requirements for delivering better services in the primary and secondary education.
Fifty five percent of the mu-nicipalities think that they further need to strengthen the capacities of the school level bodies (i.e. the principal, school board and teachers council), while 30 per cent say they should allocate more funds from their municipal budget (see Fig. 10).
2.5. Findings from Citizens Poll
Besides the input received from the municipalities, the survey also includes opinions of citizens on issues related to education and decentralization.
Five hundred twenty five citizens19 were surveyed on a questionnaire similar to the one delivered to the municipalities, in order to match instance from municipalities with expectations by the final users of the education services.
Citizens were asked to comment on their perception on the process of decentraliza-tion since its beginning, and particularly whether the management of education com-petency at the local level has improved, has not improved or remained as before.
The findings are as follows: 50 per cent stated that the management of education at the local level has ‘improved’, 14 per cent that it has ’not improved’ and 29 per cent that it 19Principals of schools (62), teachers (62), members of the school boards (62), parents of pupils (339) 18 Survey on Decentralization 2008remained ‘same as before’ (see Fig. 11).
Citizens think that cooperation between the municipalities and the schools has im-proved since the process of decentralization, as 58 per cent of surveyed citizens con-sider that the co-operation is ‘good’, 17 per cent ‘excellent’, whereas only 11 per cent think that the co-operation is ‘poor’, (see Fig. 12).
The same question posed to the municipalities about the requirements for improving services in education offered the following results: 59 per cent of citizens answered that the municipalities should allocate more funds from their budget in order that their municipalities provide better services in the field of primary and secondary edu-cation, while 21 per cent say that the capacities of the school level bodies should be strengthened.
2.6. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Decentralization in education, as a continuous and creative series of changes and ac-tions, should be analyzed under different points of view: transfer and implementation of certain education competences from the central to the local government, existence of higher level of autonomy at the school level, citizens’ evaluation of education ser-vices and last but not least, the relations among three main stakeholder levels in the process of education i.e. the central level, the local level and the school level.
When considering decentralized education, municipal and school management must be given a relevant dimension.
Principals should manage their schools in close co-operation with the school boards.
They should be given the key responsibilities of the school boards as foreseen with the legislation on primary and secondary education and, above all, they should be under the supervision of local authorities (municipali-ties).
Namely, the main bodies in the whole cycle are the school boards, their structure comprising representatives of teachers, pedagogues and professional associates; par-ents; local self-government as well as a representative of the Ministry of Education and Science.
For strengthening the responsibility of all stakeholders at the school level and in the context of co-operation with the local self-government and the wider community, the School Boards should have the key role in school management; their structure and functions are specified by Law.
The legal framework is oriented to minimize politi-cal influence in school management, provided that the school boards operate effec-tively.
The main conclusions and recommendations are the following:
Three years after the decentralization process started, the stakeholders do know their rights, roles and responsibilities, which was not the case before.
Local au-thorities show seriousness in terms of managing the education in the best possible way.
Proof of this is the establishment of administrative units by most municipalities (55 per cent), dealing specifically with education issues.
This per-centage is expected to rise in near future following the examples of the ones that have established the units.
Local authorities should intensify their communication and contacts with the school principals, the school board members and teachers, in order that the in-formation flow between all involved is circulated consistently.
Municipalities should further try to strengthen the capacities of the school level stakeholders, by providing training and other capacity building activities for raising their knowledge and understanding on their rights, roles and respon-sibilities in accordance with education and decentralization.
Although citizens responded that they know their rights, roles and responsibilities (79 per cent), strengthening the capacities of the school level stakeholders is still necessary (40 per cent of the LSGUs think that the school board needs additional capacity building training).
Political influence in education management should be minimized and be neu-tralized by all means.
One of the arguments in favor of decentralized education refers to managerial efficiency and effectiveness and to de-politicization of the educational system.
The assumption before the decentralization was that the education system was politicized and that with the decentralization the de-po-liticization would be ensured.
Although the primary and secondary education is managed from the local level, there is a need for better co-operation among municipalities and the Ministry of Education (MoE) and its branches.
The Survey findings show that some munici-palities still have poor relations with the MoE and this leads to miscommunica-tion when the process of decentralization in education should be completed.
(cid:116)(cid:1) Municipalities are aware that they should strengthen the capacities of the man-agers of the schools, school boards, teachers’ councils and other school level stakeholders but this needs to be put into practice, by allocating more funds from the municipal budget for education purposes.
This idea was supported by the citizens when asked similar questions.
3. Communal Services
3.1. General introduction
Proper management of communal enterprises by municipalities generates a number of benefits for local governments.
German municipalities have experience in establish-ing profit public companies as wellness and spa centers, public transport companies, management of tourist attractions.
In many cases these companies are the generator for local economic development.
Setting the prices and collection of fees has always been a challenge especially in tran-sition countries.
Public service prices have traditionally been lower than the service real costs due to political strategies influenced by weak economic standards and such policy has resulted in poor companies and bad services.
In order to provide adequate services the prices have to be based on real expenses22 and must cover amortization costs as well as funds for investment.
The collection of fees has always been a sig-nificant problem for communal enterprises.
Regular collection of fees determines the enterprise output, and enables the delivery of better services at lower prices.
Management is a key issue for communal enterprises.
Municipalities appoint the man-aging structure of communal enterprises, and mayors appoint managers while mu-nicipal councils select the members of managing boards and decide on initial invest-ment in equipment and facilities.
The Law on Public Enterprises23 envisages managing boards composed of 5 to 11 members, selected among available experts in communal service delivery.
Boards should also include representatives of the company’s employ-ees.
The municipality (the mayor and the council) supervises the company outputs, adopts annual working plans, the annual finance bill, and reviews reports.
The prices of services are set by the municipal council upon proposal of the communal enterprise management.
3.2. Findings of the Survey 2008
Most of the assessed communal enterprises were established between 1996 and 2007, probably as a result of the Law on Local Self-Government in 1996, a benchmark in the process of the decentralization and development of local self-government.
Although a relevant number of enterprises date back to the 50s and 60s, these records show a relatively short tradition in the management of communal enterprises.
Chart No. 2 outlines the high frequency of changes in the management of communal enterprises.
Only 3 managers served with continuity for the last 10 years, while in other municipalities turnovers occurred up to 7 times.
Managers have been replaced on av-erage once every 2.8 years.
It is questionable whether sound strategies can be imple-mented in such a timeframe.
Frequent changes in management may be the result of inadequate planning by municipalities or unsatisfactory performances by appointed managers.
Five municipalities reported their communal enterprise to have an e-mail address, and only one mentioned a communal enterprise web site.
This confirms scarce use by com-munal enterprises of the internet and modern technology for communicating not only with citizens/customers but also within the company.
Better sharing of information through modern technology will strengthen public trust in the communal enterprises and might prompt higher rates in fee collection.
Thirty seven out of the 67 assessed municipalities reported their communal enter-prises to have debts, for a total amount of 1,175,710,040 MKD.
Heavy debts seriously affect municipal budgets and limit the effectiveness of policies.
Eighty-two percent of the interviewed municipalities positively evaluated the perfor-mance of their communal enterprise, while only 53 per cent of the polled citizens25shared the same appraisal, in most of the cases ranking their communal enterprise services between 3 and 4 on a scale when 1 is the worst and 5 is the best.
Fifty two percent of our opinion poll sample stated that the communal services prices are inappropriate.
The majority of these citizens (92 per cent) consider prices to be too high and only 5 per cent reckon them to be lower than they should be.
Sixty three percent of the citizens would not agree to pay higher prices even if the services were better, and 91 per cent claimed to pay regularly communal enterprises fees.
Low incomes are the most frequent reason for unpaid bills.
As previously mentioned, proper price setting is one of the most important require-ments for a sustainable and effective service delivery.
Only 46 per cent of the mu-nicipalities consider charged fees to be in line with the services real cost, which means that prices are lower than real costs in 54 per cent of the cases.
When fees do not cover expenditures, there are two options: prices must be increased, or expenses must be reduced.
A third option is subsidizing the work of the communal enterprise from the municipal budget.
Further analysis and assessment regarding the setting of the prices is needed; col-lected results showed large ranges in price setting among municipalities.
Regarding the price for collection of 1 ton of garbage, prices reported by the municipalities range from couple of hundred MKD to few thousands MKD.
This may indicate that the mu-nicipalities do not have enough data or systems to follow the work of their public en-terprises or do not have the capacity to make a proper assessment of the expenses and cost related to their services in order to set the prices accordingly.
3.3. How to improve the work of the communal enterprises?
This survey investigated the problems faced by municipalities in communal service delivery and on their strategies to tackle such issues.
A recurring hurdle for many municipalities and communal enterprises is the lack of financial resources, which are needed in order to procure necessary equipment.
Both the citizens and the munici-palities identified the lack of equipment as a major problem that prevents improved service provision.
The biggest number (78 per cent) of municipalities considers the lack of equipment as the biggest problem for the communal enterprises.
If we compare the results of the Chart No. 6 on the opinion of the municipalities with the opinion of the citizens in the citizens poll ordered by the OSCE we will get opposite and different perceptions: 
Lack of assistance by the state was mentioned by 54 per cent of municipalities, which is a significant number.
This survey did not explore the reasons and what kind of state assistance is requested.
In line with this opinion we have to mention that 85.5 per cent of municipalities stated that they agree that the Law on Public Enterprises is good.
Ad-ditionally the state had positive response to the request to lower the VAT rate for com-munal services to 5 per cent which was one of the major problems for the communal enterprises and municipalities during the OSCE survey in 2007.
According to the citizens’ opinion, lack of equipment is stated as the biggest prob-lem for the communal enterprises.
Great number of citizens supports the purchase of equipment as a necessity but they believe that this should be done within the current pricing of the services.
The opinion of the citizens regarding the more “honest” work can be interpreted as a view of the citizens that the companies can improve the way they lower unnecessary expenditures.
While the citizens are not willing to pay more for the services (Chart No. 5) the communal enterprises and the municipalities are challenged to find ways how to utilize better the current assets with better management and to provide better fi-nancial conditions by cutting down expenses.
The following Chart No. 8 shows that the majority (67 per cent) of the municipal strategies to improve the services refer to providing equipment for their communal enterprise.
Only 33 per cent of the municipalities consider the Public Private Partnerships - PPP as a tool for service improvement; and 25 per cent intends to enter in Inter-Municipal Co-operation - IMC agreements.
Even fewer consider outsourcing (i.e. purchase services from the neighboring municipalities).
Nineteen per cent of the municipalities deem that ISO standards will improve communal service delivery.
When analyzing (Chart No. 9) the obstacles to improving the services, lack of finances is considered the predominant obstacle for 87 per cent of the municipalities.
The rea-son for the lack of finances an equal number (34 per cent in both cases) of municipali-ties consider to be the low fee collection and the low prices of the services.
3.4. Garbage separation
The survey assessed citizens’ readiness to participate in the garbage recycling, an ac-tivity which could be a source of income for the municipalities and the communal enterprises.
An overwhelming majority of the polled population would commit itself in garbage separation activities.
Citizens in favor of garbage recycling expect their municipality and communal enter-prise to take actions such as providing equipment (special containers), running aware-ness campaigns and reducing fees on other communal services.
3.5. Recommendations
Most of the transition countries in South-East Europe inherited weak systems of com-munal service provision due to unrealistic prices, inefficient communal enterprises, lack of equipment and obsolete infrastructures (i.e. water and sewage networks).
Many programs have since then been implemented for improving service provi-sion, and nearly all implied additional investments and a consequent matching of charged fees with service costs.
In other words, experience shows that better results are possible at the cost of reviewing prices.
This does not seem to be a viable solu-tion when considering the current economic constraints and a general reluctance to accept higher fees.
It is therefore necessary to consider further possibilities for more efficient and ef-fective service provision, thus enabling a cost reduction for communal enterprises activities.
This requires development of sound strategies and plans by a carefully selected management and more capacity building initiatives for the current staff in the municipal companies.
Several strategies can be pursued for increasing the efficiency of communal compa-nies, for instance, assessing municipal capacities in terms of covered territory and/or consumers served.
This will help in choosing the best and cheapest way for service provision (Inter-Municipal Co-operation by the establishment of a joint enterprise, Public Private Partnership or outsourcing by buying services from a private company or a neighboring municipality’s communal enterprise).
Debt management currently stands out as a serious threat to municipal communal enterprises, both for the amounts at stake and the alleged inability of companies and municipalities to deal efficiently with it.
The matter must soon be addressed, without the risk of leaving large sectors of the population destitute of basic supplies such as water.
For instance, the central authorities can play an intermediary role and possibly enable municipalities to raise loans from the commercial banks under pref-erential conditions.
This is necessary because the old debts of the communal enter-prises block the enterprise account.
This blocks the work of the enterprise because it prevents regular payments.
Additionally the enterprises debts are increasing be-cause the compound interest rate is much higher than the interest rates of the bank loans.
Enabling bank loans for the purpose of reprogramming existing debts would provide several benefits.
By using bank loans the enterprises and the municipalities will be able to reschedule their debts and to plan their repayment by installments.
The payment of the installments will be planned in the budget of the enterprise and it will not block its bank account.
This will ensure continuous provision of services and lower expenses for the enterprises and the municipality, alike.
The establishment of a Municipal Consumers Council28 would help municipalities to improve communication with the citizens.
The Council would serve as a forum for discussing fee collection and negotiating appropriate prices in regard to the desired quality of the services.
Local Economic Development
4.1. Introduction and legal background
The Law on Local Self-Government enacted in 2002 substantially enlarges the com-petences of local officials, and LED (Local Economic Development) was one of the first responsibilities transferred to the municipal level.
Article 22 of the Law on Local Self-Government29 prescribes the LED as a local self-government competence and leaves room for the municipalities to construct their own method of planning and imple-menting LED activities.
Another important part of the general legal framework on LED is the 2007 Law on Balanced Regional Development, the aim of which is to determine the goals, regulations and bearers of the policy for regional development planning, financing and allocation of funds for balanced regional development, evaluation and monitoring of the implementation of the development plans and projects and other related issues.
A thorough implementation of the Local Economic Development concept requires serious engagement by the municipalities in terms of human and financial resources in order to foster growth and improve living standards within their respective munici-pal area.
This chapter depicts the status of LED as a cross-cutting competence of the local self-government units both from a municipal and a business community perspective.
It provides information on the active approach the municipalities have been taking to-wards LED (systematic or ad hoc based) and the state of affairs of the LED plans, as well as the most frequent activities and obstacles for their implementation.
Furthermore, it checks on the existence of accurate information on the local opera-tional businesses as a basis for future planning of LED, the role and importance of the PPPs as an LED tool, the frequency of engagement of municipalities in cross border co-operations and the role and activities implemented within the existing planning regions for equal regional development.
A review of financing methods for activities conducted by the LED offices or the LED Coordinators will be followed by trends in allocation of municipal budget funds for LED and by the main expectations from the central government.
An outline of the municipal budgets allocated for balanced regional development will also be given.
Finally, the chapter points out the efforts of the municipalities to improve the busi-ness climate and the perception of the business community on their relevance and success.
4.2. Municipalities
The results show that 61 per cent of the surveyed municipalities have formally planned their LED activities for the period 2007-2008.
An increase of 6.7 per cent can be noted when compared to the last year survey results.
Municipal strategies for LED are most usually planned on a 4 to 5 year time frame.
Twelve and a half per cent of the munici-palities covered the period 2003-2008 and 40.3 per cent covered 2007-2013.
A negligible number of municipalities have already developed the LED long term plans (for instance, Tearce LED plan covers the period 2006-2016 and Veles has planned LED until 2020).
