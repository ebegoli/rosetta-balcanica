ODIHR Special Election Assessment Mission Final Report
Following an invitation from the authorities of the Republic of North Macedonia and in accordance with its mandate, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) deployed a Special Election Assessment Mission (SEAM) for the 15 July early parliamentary elections.
The SEAM resumed the election observation process commenced by the ODIHR Election Observation Mission (EOM) which was suspended on 17 March following the introduction of restrictions on cross-border travel throughout the OSCE region related to the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The ODIHR SEAM assessed compliance of the electoral process with OSCE commitments, other international obligations and standards for democratic elections, as well as national legislation.
The Statement of Preliminary Findings and Conclusions issued on 16 July concluded that the early parliamentary elections “were generally administered effectively amid adjustments in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but legal stability was undermined by substantial revisions to the Electoral Code and subsequent ad hoc regulations enacted during the state of emergency.
The campaign, although negative in tone, was genuinely competitive and participants could deliver their messages despite limitations on traditional outreach.
Media coverage of the elections lacked critical assessment of platforms, whereas provisions regarding paid political advertisement favoured the three largest parties.
Election day proceeded smoothly, despite technical challenges in publishing results and concerns related to voter registration.”
Early parliamentary elections were initially scheduled for 12 April 2020, and the electoral process was subsequently suspended amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
The state of emergency announced by the president on 18 March, initially for 30 days, was extended four times and lasted until 22 June.
The election date of 15 July was determined by protracted negotiations between political parties, related to the need to reconstitute a permanent government and parliament as well as safety measures for conducting elections during the pandemic.
The elections were conducted under a legal framework that was substantially amended on the eve of the announcement of the elections, contrary to international good practice.
The introduced amendments only partially addressed some ODIHR recommendations, while long-standing recommendations pertaining to revision of electoral district boundaries by an independent body, rights of persons with disabilities, the universality and equality of the vote in the electoral district abroad, and an effective campaign finance audit remain unaddressed.
The persisting inconsistencies, gaps and ambiguous formulations underline the need for a comprehensive reform of the electoral legal framework well in advance of forthcoming elections.
The election administration, composed of the State Election Commission (SEC), Municipal Election Commissions (MECs), and Electoral Boards, operated in a largely professional manner despite complications caused by the suspension of the electoral process, the state of emergency and the adjustments necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The SEC fulfilled its duties within legal deadlines and in a fairly transparent manner.
Public confidence in the election administration was partially undermined by technical challenges in the publication of results.
The authorities undertook a number of measures to adjust the electoral process to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic.
An additional early voting day was established to enfranchise COVID-19 positive voters and those in self-isolation.
The SEC adopted instructions outlining health protocols for different stages of the electoral process and polling station premises were reviewed to accommodate distancing requirements.
The SEC also conducted a comprehensive voter education campaign on health-related adjustments to election day procedures.
Longstanding structural issues related to the voter register, such as a lack of standardization of address data, harmonization and interoperability across institutions as well as of detailed instructions on voter registration procedures remain unaddressed.
Although the amended Electoral Code introduced a Central Population Register as a new source for the voter register, it could not be used for these elections due to incomplete data.
The SEC’s limited IT capacity combined with a recent lack of comprehensive quality control further affected the quality of the register.
Candidate registration was completed prior to the suspension of the elections, in an inclusive process.
Commendably, the SEC issued guidelines which provided a checklist for candidates and a detailed verification procedure, launched a new online application for submission of candidate lists and published all lists of candidates on its webpage with an interactive tool, which displayed candidates’ party affiliation, gender, electoral district and municipality.
A total of 12 political parties and 3 coalitions fielded 1,598 candidates on 78 lists.
These included 675 women candidates (42 per cent), and women headed 19 of 78 lists.
These candidates remained registered once the electoral process resumed following the state of emergency.
The visibility of female candidates remained low. Although women constituted 42 per cent of registered candidates, ODIHR SEAM monitoring indicates that coverage of women politicians by media varied between mere 4 and 14 per cent of candidate coverage.
Women candidates met by the ODIHR SEAM described a lack of support for prospective women leaders in internal party structures.
The campaign was marked by negative rhetoric and personal attacks between party leaders, at the expense of substantive exchanges.
Leaking of a series of clandestine recordings of political leaders further contributed to the negative tone.
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered the style of campaign as series of government decrees outlined safety measures to be applied at public meetings.
Parties replaced traditional rallies with small-scale meetings and limited door-to-door canvassing.
Despite the circumstances, parties campaigned actively and were able to deliver their messages.
The ODIHR SEAM noted isolated cases of ministers from different parties blurring their state functions and political activities.
Political parties also reported to the ODIHR SEAM cases of pressure on public officials, especially in the west of the country, including attempts to instrumentalize the police.
The legal framework on campaign financing requires further harmonisation to eliminate gaps and inconsistencies.
The agencies tasked with campaign finance oversight lack capacity due to insufficient budgeting and human resources, which undermined their control over the accountability and transparency of campaign financing.
Most political parties assessed the interim reporting framework as superfluous and burdensome, and not all contestants submitted all interim reports, despite a legal requirement.
As the SEC did not consistently publish contestants’ reports, and the third-party reports were not published, transparency was lacking.
All ODIHR SEAM interlocutors noted that significant improvements in media freedoms in recent years were not reinforced by systematic reforms in the media sector, such as ensuring the political neutrality of the public broadcaster and the media regulator.
The legal framework for the allocation of funds for paid time, and the distribution of maximum limits for paid political advertisements, was modified by a government decree enacted on 22 June, the last day of the state of emergency.
The provisions favoured three bigger parties, which were together legally granted the amounts and time allocations several times greater than the other twelve contestants combined.
During the official campaign period all national terrestrial broadcasters largely focused their coverage on mutual accusations between leaders of major political parties, while in-depth analytical reporting or policybased discussions were largely absent.
The majority of election-related complaints are within the jurisdiction of the SEC, except complaints related to campaign and political finance and misuse of administrative resources, which lay within the jurisdiction of the State Commission for Prevention of Corruption (SCPC).
The SCPC established violations in two of six complaints alleging abuse of state resources, one of which was eventually overturned by the Administrative Court in appeal.
The SEC rejected all complaints on early campaigning as well as complaints on electoral irregularities and elections results as unsubstantiated by evidence or inadmissible since the alleged violation occurred during the state of emergency which suspended the electoral process.
The new competence exercised by MECs to examine complaints during early voting and on election day resulted in dual jurisdiction with the SEC for some complaints, and some election day complaints remained unexamined by the SEC.
Restrictions on the right to challenge electoral irregularities and results, as well as a formalistic approach to the review of complaints, did not ensure the effective legal remedy.
The ODIHR SEAM did not undertake systematic or comprehensive observation of early voting and election-day proceedings, although on 15 July it did visit a limited number of polling stations.
Early voting and election day itself generally proceeded in an orderly manner and without major incidents or tension.
On election night, the SEC reported a cyber-attack, which caused the SEC’s website to crash.
The publication of election results was affected by technical challenges.
The SEC conducted additional tabulation of results on the basis of hard copies of the final protocols, but the technical problems led to speculations about the transparency of the process and, eventually, to official investigations.
This report offers a number of recommendations to support efforts to bring elections in North Macedonia further in line with OSCE commitments and other international obligations and standards for democratic elections.
Priority recommendations relate to reform of legal framework, harmonization of data for voter register, increased capacity of the campaign finance oversight institutions, unimpeded access to paid political advertisement, and cyber-security of electoral process.
ODIHR stands ready to assist the authorities to improve the electoral process and to address the recommendations contained in this and prior reports.
Following an invitation from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) of the Republic of North Macedonia, and in accordance with its mandate, the OSCE Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR), on 19 June deployed a Special Election Assessment Mission (SEAM) headed by Laima Andrikienė.
The ODIHR SEAM consisted of a core team of nine international experts, who were based in Skopje and visited Aračinovo, Gostivar, Ilinden, Kumanovo, Lipkovo, Tetovo, and Vrapčište.
The electoral process was assessed for compliance with OSCE commitments, other international obligations and standards for democratic elections, and with national legislation.
The SEAM did not carry out systematic or comprehensive observation of the voting, counting and tabulation proceedings on election day, in line with ODIHR’s methodology for election assessment missions.
Mission members did, however, visit a limited number of polling stations on election day.
The ODIHR EAM wishes to thank the MFA and the State Election Commission (SEC) for their cooperation and assistance, as well as to express gratitude to representatives of other state institutions, election commissions, political parties, candidates, media, civil society, academia, the resident diplomatic community, and other interlocutors for sharing their views.
Early parliamentary elections were initially scheduled for 12 April 2020.
The decision to call early elections was precipitated by the European Council’s decision in October 2019 not to open negotiations on the country’s accession to the European Union (EU), which prompted the government to resign.
On 3 January 2020, the prime minister resigned and, in line with the 2015 Przino Agreement, a caretaker government including opposition ministers took office for the 100 days preceding the scheduled elections.
On 16 February, the parliamentary speaker dissolved the parliament and called elections for 12 April, some eight months before the expiration of the parliamentary term.
Amid the global outbreak of COVID-19, on 18 March the president declared a 30-day state of emergency, and on 21 March the elections were suspended by a governmental decree, which provided that the electoral process would resume from the day the state of emergency was lifted.
The state of emergency, which granted the caretaker government extraordinary legislative powers, was extended four times, on the final occasion for only eight days for the purpose of re-scheduling the elections.
A number of challenges to the legitimacy of presidential decisions introducing a state of emergency without parliamentary approval and of the legislative powers vested in the government were brought to the Constitutional Court (see also Complaints and Appeals).
The election date of 15 July was determined following protracted negotiations between political parties, focused on the need to reconstitute a regular government and parliament and safety measures for conducting elections during the pandemic.
These were the fifth consecutive early parliamentary elections since 2008, and many interlocutors described political and economic ramifications of this instability.
The previous parliamentary elections were held in December 2016, when six parties and coalitions gained representation in the parliament.
Although the coalition led by the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization – Democratic Party of Macedonian National Unity (VMRO-DPMNE) won more seats, a new government was formed in April 2017 by a coalition that was led by the Social Democratic Union of Macedonia (SDSM) and included the mainly ethnic-Albanian Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
In general, women are under-represented in public life.
Measures in the Electoral Code to promote female candidates in party lists boosted the representation of women in the outgoing parliament, with 47 women out of 120 MPs.
However, women are less visible in the executive.
Only 5 of 24 ministers in the outgoing government were women, and only 6 of 81 mayors.
While the elections were on hold, key developments took place in the EU and NATO accession processes.
On 24 March, the EU’s General Affairs Council approved the opening of accession negotiations with North Macedonia, and on 27 March the country formally became a member of the NATO alliance.


The parliament is a unicameral body comprising 120 to 123 members that is directly elected for a four-year term under a proportional representation model using closed lists.
Seats are allocated to candidate lists according to the D’Hondt method of highest average.
Twenty members of parliament (MPs) are elected from each of the six in-country electoral districts, and up to three MPs are elected from a single out-of-country electoral district.
The number of MPs elected in the district abroad is conditioned by a threshold linked to the previous election results without a correlation to voter turnout, which was previously criticized by ODIHR and the Venice Commission for failing to comply with the principle of universal suffrage.
North Macedonia has ratified key international and regional human rights instruments pertaining to the holding of democratic elections.
The legal framework for the conduct of parliamentary elections includes the 1991 Constitution (last amended in 2019), the 2006 Electoral Code (last amended in February 2020), the 2004 Law on Political Parties, the 2004 Law on Financing Political Parties (amended in 2018), and regulations adopted by the SEC to supplement the law.
The elections were conducted under a legal framework substantially amended on the eve of the announcement of the elections, contrary to international good practice.
Amendments introduced into the Electoral Code in February 2020 partially addressed some ODIHR recommendations on issues such as voter registration, transparency of election dispute resolution, deadlines for campaign finance reporting, and campaign oversight.
Still, some ODIHR recommendations remain unaddressed, including those on the rights of persons with disabilities, recruitment and dismissal procedures of election administration members, campaign finance rules, an effective campaign finance audit and sanctioning.
The majority of SEAM interlocutors, including the SEC, state agencies, and political parties, underlined the need for a comprehensive reform of electoral legislation.
The persisting inconsistencies, gaps, expired and inapplicable provisions, and ambiguous formulations in the legal framework undermine legal certainty and require further substantive revision.
Inconsistent regulations include the norms on maintenance and modification of the voter register, unaligned deadlines for voter and candidate registration, campaigning and related deadlines, determination of prices for political advertising and distribution of political advertising quotas among campaign participants, compensation for campaign expenditures, reporting on in-kind contributions for campaign purposes, scope of financial reporting, closure of campaign accounts, division of disputeresolution competencies between election management bodies.
The new provisions on fingerprinting during voter identification require revision to ensure that the procedures pursue a legitimate aim and include data protection requirements.
Provisions related to budgetary compensation of campaign expenditure are no longer valid, as these entitlements were repealed, and need to be abolished.
The February 2020 changes to the Electoral Code were adopted under an expedited procedure, without general debate, contrary to previous ODIHR recommendations and parliamentary Rules of Procedure.
The proposals of an inter-agency working group tasked with amending the Electoral Code were not incorporated.
The hasty adoption hampered the effective implementation of the amendments, as some previous regulatory deficiencies were not eliminated, and administrative capacity and infrastructure were not always ensured.
The Electoral Code should be comprehensively reviewed in order to harmonize it internally and with other relevant laws, to bring it in line with OSCE commitments, international obligations and good practice.
The revision should be done in a public procedure, after a broadly inclusive consultation process and sufficiently in advance of the next elections in order to guarantee legal certainty.
The Electoral Code allows up to five per cent deviation from the average number of voters per electoral district.
Wider disparities existed in four districts.
The February 2020 amendments to the Electoral Code altered the boundaries of two districts, moving two municipalities, Debar and Mavrovo-Rostuse, from electoral district six to district five.
Despite deviation in excess of the legal limit in districts three and four, these district boundaries remained unchanged.
To ensure equality of the vote, legislation should foresee periodic review of district boundaries by an independent body.
When district boundaries are redefined, it should be done in a timely, transparent, impartial and inclusive manner under a clear and consistent methodology.
Despite interpretation by the Constitutional Court that legislative powers of the government during a state of emergency shall be calibrated to the specific needs, the binding governmental decrees covered a vast area of public life, including electoral procedures within the competence of institutions under the Electoral Code, substituting the decisions of these institutions.
The decrees regulated the resumption and conduct of the electoral process, the validity of previously completed procedures, voter registration, campaigning in the media, and established standards and procedures for compliance with health protocols, including an additional voting day for COVID-19 positive voters and those in self-isolation.
The governmental regulations on indoor and outdoor events was amended multiple times and lacked consistency and consolidation, undermining legal certainty and implementation.
Overall, the constant generation of amendments to the decrees diminished the general understanding of their substance and validity.
